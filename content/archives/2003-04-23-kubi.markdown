<p>I just had a look at the online demo for <a href="http://www.kubisoftware.com/" title="Kubi Software, Inc.">Kubi Client</a>, a collaboration tool that's embeddable in Outlook in Notes and offers some of <a href="http://www.groove.net">Groove</a>'s features without requiring any additional infrastructure. It seems a nice idea to rely on SMTP only, although I always hate to even look at software from companies that make statements like this:<br />
</p><blockquote><a href="http://www.kubisoftware.com/news_newsroom_pr5.aspx">The company&quot;s patent-pending protocol is SMTP-based, enabling it to cross firewalls and leverage the worldwide messaging network, and XML-formatted, to unify the differences between competing Email platforms. </a></blockquote><br />
How can the idea of sending XML over SMTP possibly be worth a patent? <br />
Anyway, since this is something unavoidable with US based companies, I'll take a look at it anyway.
