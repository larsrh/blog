<p>In all fairness, Mike Champion makes an excellent argument <a href="http://www.25hoursaday.com/weblog/CommentView.aspx?guid=2de82d9a-7e46-4cb2-a787-3786e67e1780#d07e7e1f-a72e-46fa-b1af-9fd2925417e2">in a comment</a> at Dare&#8217;s blog:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The strength of the service-oriented approach as opposed to a resource-oriented or spaces-oriented approach, is that it is a whole lot easier to map those unconstrained verbs to the existing software infrastructure that nobody dares to rewrite than it would be to reconceptualize it using some unfamiliar paradigm.</p>

<p>I agree; while I&#8217;m convinced the REST style has significant advantages, it requires a change that &#8212; at least in some cases &#8212; may not be worth it. After one of my last REST talks, I got into a discussion with someone who had opened up a bunch of RPG programs with a generic Web services layer, and given that they were transactional in nature anyway, this was arguably much easier than rethinking them in resource terms.</p>
