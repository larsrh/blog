<p>I&#8217;ve just stumbled across <a href="http://franklinmint.fm/2006/02/16/draft-sayre-2-way-rss-02.html">Robert Sayre&#8217;s RESTful 2-way RSS</a> &#8212; which looks like an RSS version of the Atom publishing protocol (of which there is <a href="http://bitworking.org/projects/atom/">a new draft</a>, too). I have no idea what the point of this is, though &#8230;</p>
