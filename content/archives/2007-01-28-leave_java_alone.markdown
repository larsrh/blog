<p><a href="http://cafe.elharo.com/java/why-java-doesnt-need-properties-it-already-has-them/">Elliotte Rusty Harold argues</a> that people should leave Java alone, and stop adding features upon features to what is already a pretty big language (case in point: closures and properties). I tend to agree, but check out this <a href="http://www.megginson.com/blogs/quoderat/2007/01/25/tech-botox/">comment from Mike Champion</a> over on <a href="http://www.megginson.com/blogs/quoderat/2007/01/25/tech-botox/">David Megginson&#8217;s blog</a> for a different perspective.</p>
