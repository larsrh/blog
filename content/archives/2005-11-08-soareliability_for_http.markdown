<p>The name sucks, but <a href="http://www.goland.org/soareliability/">the content</a> is very interesting:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>SOAR-ity is intended to allow for &#8220;reliable&#8221; (this term is almost always a misnomer) messaging over HTTP. It achieves this goal by introducing two new request headers, Message-ID which provides a unique ID for a message and MsgCreate which contains the date and time on which the first instance of the message with the associated Message-ID was sent. The purpose of the Message-ID/MsgCreate pair is to allow any HTTP request (e.g. any HTTP method can be used) to be repeated multiple times with a guarantee that the message will be processed no more than one time. In essence it makes any HTTP method call idempotent.

<p>The best link to use for SOA-Reliability (and yes, the name sucks) is <a href="http://www.goland.org/soareliability/." rel="nofollow" /><a href="http://www.goland.org/soareliability/." rel="nofollow">http://www.goland.org/soareliability/.</a> It will point to the latest draft.</p>
