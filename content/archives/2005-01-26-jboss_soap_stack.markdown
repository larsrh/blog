<p><a href="http://www.1060.org/blogxter/entry?publicid=2A879B67D0F3E8F64F74C530DEC981A6">Steve</a> comments on the JBoss SOAP Stack. I share his view (or at least what I perceive to be his view :-): It&#8217;s hard enough to maintain one Open Source stack, and the last thing anybody benefits from is having a fork &#8212; especially not one that is driven by Sun&#8217;s API-centric view of Web Services as evidenced in the JCP specs.</p>
