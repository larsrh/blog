<p>The September 2005 release of our Web Services standards overview is now available &#8212; thanks to all of you who have <a href="/blog/st/2005/08/26/web_services_standards.html">provided feedback</a>. Your paper copies are on their way :-) </p>

<p>The poster is available <a href="/soa/ws-standards/poster/">in PDF format</a>. Be warned, though: The amount of information requires at least a DIN A1 printer.</p>

<p>We&#8217;ve tried our best to come up with a correct, current, and reasonably complete overview. Let me know whether this is useful to you, and please point out any mistakes or glaring omissions. I promise a DIN A0 paper copy to anybody who finds an error &#8230;</p>

<p>I promptly asked for, and got, 3 copies of this.  I have the advntage of living just around the corner from Stefan and InnoQ in Germany, so the logistical problems were minimal :)).  Anyway, I just wanted to say that the poster is really quite nice.  It&#8217;s a moving target, of course, so it will undoubtedly be outdated in a year or so.  But for the time being, it&#8217;s a great tool.  It doesn&#8217;t answer any questions about the WS-* standards soup, per se.  Rather, I see it as a &#8220;birds-eye&#8221; overview of the state-of-the-practice.  I&#8217;ll be using it as a starting point for Googling quite a bit, I expect.  Oh, and one more thing &#8212; it&#8217;s HUGE!  ;)</p>
