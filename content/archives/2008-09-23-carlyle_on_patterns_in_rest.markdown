<p><a href="http://soundadvice.id.au/blog/2008/09/22#rest-patterns">Benjamin Carlyle</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>REST patterns are typically implemented in terms of methods, response codes, and headers. They are agnostic to content and the specific URLs they operate on. They transfer opaque documents according to their mechanics to nominated URL end-points. The set of patterns in a given architecture should be small and well-defined in terms of its intent and its mechanics.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I'm in the process of documenting some patterns, too, but I'm much more liberal in my application of the term. But as usual, Benjamin's is cleaner and a little more scientific â€“ sound advice, as usual.</p>
