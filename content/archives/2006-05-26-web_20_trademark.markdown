<p>It seems &#8220;Web 2.0&#8221; is <a href="http://www.tomrafteryit.net/oreilly-trademarks-web-20-and-sets-lawyers-on-itcork/">about to be trademarked</a> by O&#8217;Reilly:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>One of these events - the upcoming Web 2.0 half-day conference is the target of a cease and desist letter (below) from the legal team of O&#8217;Reilly publishers. Basically O&#8217;Reilly are claiming to have applied for a trademark for the term &#8220;Web 2.0&#8243; and therefore IT@Cork can&#8217;t use the term for its conference. Apparantly use of the term &#8220;Web 2.0&#8243; is a &#8220;flagrant violation&#8221; of their trademark rights!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Great news, maybe that&#8217;ll lead to an early death of the absurd term. (No, I don&#8217;t really believe that. But one can dream).</p>

<p>That&#8217;s ridiculous. So far for the social aspect of Web 2.0 as far as O&#8217;Reilly is concerned. However there is a simple yet elegant solution to this: let&#8217;s just call it Web 2.1 or Web 3.0, as that would make O’Reilly’s Web 2.0 obsolete ;-).</p>
