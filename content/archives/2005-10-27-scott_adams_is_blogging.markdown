<blockquote>
<p>Recently I was traveling and ordered breakfast from room service. They guy who delivered it is evidently the type who avoids all sources of news. I say this with some confidence not just because of his carefree demeanor, but also because he looks exactly like Saddam Hussein. As a general rule, if you find that you look like a brutal dictator, it&#8217;s time to update your look. Shave the mustache, do something with the hair, get an earring &#8211; that sort of thing. But he seemed quite happy with himself. I&#8217;m sure he wasn&#8217;t actually Saddam himself, but I over-tipped him just to err on the cautious side.</p>
