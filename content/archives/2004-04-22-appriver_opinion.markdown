<p><strong>Yet Another Update</strong>: Yet another update - removed the original text, since we&#8217;re very happy with AppRiver at the moment and have no intention of misleading people who only quickly skim Google results.
<strong>Update</strong>: Folks at AppRiver clearly took my complaint seriously, help resolved the issue, so for the moment we&#8217;ve switched back (and so far, everything seems to run smoothly).</p>

<p>We are sorry and concerned that you have had issues with our service.  We have been battling issues with firewalls blocking the connections from our servers because of the way we deliver queued mail which causes mail to start backlogging as each successive try cause the connection to reset by the customers firewall and thus gets even more backed up.  We are certainly sorry to see you go but if there is anything we can do help in the meantime please feel to let me know me personally.</p>

<p>Thanks in advance,</p>

<p>Follow up to my previous post&#8230; An issue concerning certain brands of firewalls blocking connections from our queuing servers has been resolved thanks to the cooperation of the firewall manufacturers.</p>

<p>So, an update is due: After we had decided to switch from AppRiver to a self-hosted solution, they got in touch again, promised they&#8217;d do everything to help us resolve this, and refund if we were not satisfied. So we decided to give them a second try.</p>

<p>And about three days later - today - we stop receiving emails again. But this time it seems there&#8217;s a perfectly rational explanation (related to our rather strange mail setup, which led to one of our own hosts to be identified as a spam relay), along with a fix. So for the moment, we&#8217;re happy, but very, very carefully monitoring what happens &#8230;</p>

<p>We also use AppRiver and I have had a strange problem with messages to a select few recipients being returned with the &#8216;550 Relaying not allowed&#8217; tag indicating that, in these cases my mail server thinks I&#8217;m not in its domain. The message was allowed thru for thirty + other recipients of the same email. As your last problem sounds similar, any suggestions?</p>
