<p>It&#8217;s nice to find an <a href="http://www.artima.com/weblogs/viewpost.jsp?thread=59975">article about SOA</a> that one can really, thoroughly, and whole-heartedly disagree with so easily:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The bottom line [about Web services] is that there are too many important characteristics lost due to the design assumptions of hiding remoteness and providing language-independence. If you are considering employing SOA, then consider what&#8217;s been written here, and consider a pure Java and Jini approach over Web Services for building your Service Oriented Architecture.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Web services hiding remoteness? Interfaces in a strongly-typed language more suited for SOA than message-based contracts? Come on.</p>

<p>Steve,</p>

<p>It&#8217;s easy to whole-heartedly disagree with anything. Maybe you could take the time to explain why you disagree.
Thanks,
Sean</p>
