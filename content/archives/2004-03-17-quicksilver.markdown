<p>It took me almost 12 weeks to get through the 915 pages of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0380977427">Neal Stephenson&#8217;s <em>Quicksilver</em></a> &mdash; that translates to 76.25 pages per week, slightly less than 11 pages per day. That&#8217;s an unusually long time for me to read a book this size, and it was due to the fact that it&#8217;s a pretty complicated story with lots of different characters, historical detail, colorful language, and many hidden links &mdash; a very complex piece of work, and not an easy read.</p>

<p>And after all this time, I find out that it <em>really</em> is only one third of a story. Truly amazing. </p>

<p>I can&#8217;t wait for the next volume &#8230;</p>

<p>I haven&#8217;t yet bought Quicksilver but if it&#8217;s half as good as one of Stepheson&#8217;s previous novels - &#8216;Snow Crash&#8217; I would not hesitate a single moment. </p>

<p>I remember to really enjoy reading that well-composed story where virtual reality is built upon the theme of Sumerian myths, especially because I was deeply immersed myself in study of old Sumerian civilization these days. I even liked the story more than Gibson&#8217;s Neuromancer.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve also read Diamond Age which was a little disappointment for me but probably just because I had expected something else more aligned with previous novel.</p>

<p>BTW have you read anything by Robert Holdstock?</p>

<p>Strangely enough, I don&#8217;t know any of Stephenson&#8217;s SciFi novels - Quicksilver is only the second book by him I&#8217;ve read, after Cryptonomicon (which I also enjoyed very much). A colleague has recommended Snow Crash, too, so that&#8217;s likely to be one of my next purchases. (And I loved Neuromancer, so if it&#8217;s considered to be better, I will definitely give it a try ;-)) </p>

<p>I don&#8217;t know Holdstock; thanks for the recommendation, though (if it was intended to be one).</p>
