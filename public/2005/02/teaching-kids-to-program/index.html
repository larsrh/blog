I&#8217;ve been thinking about the right way to teach my kids (well, my son at least, for the girl it may be a little early) to program without spoiling the fun of it. A few of the comments pointed to <a href="http://www.toontalk.com">ToonTalk</a>, which seems to be very interesting.</p>

<p>My team is developing a new language and IDE just for the purpose of teaching children to program.</p>

<p>The language is visually similar to BASIC, so it&#8217;s easy for programming parents and non-programming kids to read and learn, but has some very important differences. </p>

<p>One way that this product is targeted at kids is by making it easy for them to get visual results without having to learn how to create a window, a graphics device, etc. </p>

<p>It supports typed variables, decisions with if-then-else, loops, methods, functions, structures, arrays, and other important basic programming concepts. </p>

<p>It&#8217;s not complete, being at Technological Preview stage, and development is still ocurring on this product. </p>

<p>We would love it if people would give it a look-see and maybe provide feedback, especially those in the development community. </p>

<p>Obviously, we hope that you love it, but if you don&#8217;t we&#8217;d really like to know why. </p>
