<p>Now, this shouldn&#8217;t be too hard. <a href="http://bitworking.org/">Joe Gregorio</a> poses a <a href="http://bitworking.org/news/The_Pascal_String_Challenge">challenge</a>: Write a blog entry that is exactly 255 characters long - exactly the number of characters that would fit in a PASCAL string. Annoyingly dumb, with absolutely no point - so why bother at all?</p>
