<p>One of my former favorite bands seems to be  <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2004/04/28/marillion_comeback/">making a comeback</a> and change some rules along the way. Nice article, interesting quote from Marillion&#8217;s new (still new to me, at least) front man, Steve Hogarth:</p>

<blockquote>[W]hile pressure has been put on file-sharing technologies such as Napster and Kazaa, it is difficult to see what protections can exist against the biggest file sharer of them all - email. &#8220;As soon as we can send an email and attach an entire album, music will become free,&#8221; says Steve.</blockquote>
