<p>Joel Spolsky <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/ThePerilsofJavaSchools.html">writes</a> about the lack of challenges when teaching programming using Java. I believe he&#8217;s right &#8212; just compare the quality of popular open source software written in C to the huge amount of crap done in Java. Sometimes a higher barrier to entry is a good thing &#8230;</p>
