<p>So I finally got myself an <a href="http://www.apple.com/ipod/">iPod</a> (the 20GB model). Very neat, as was to be expected. I have it filled up to one third now, maybe I should have bought the 40GB one or waited for the rumored 60GB model &#8230; anyway, it&#8217;s truly great to be able to carry your complete CD collection around. Unfortunately, all of the solutions to connect it to my car  stereo look rather messy - even though some people really provide <a href="http://jeff.binaryfeed.org/a4-ipod-install/">detailed instructions</a>, I&#8217;m not really willing to rip up my car&#8217;s interior.</p>

<p>If you have a 3G iPod, you have a dock connector. Look at his</p>

<p>Power and line-out from the same cable. Connect to the line-in of your car stereo (CD changer) and you are done.</p>

<p>Thanks. My problem, though, is not really with the iPod side, but with the car stereo. It&#8217;s an Audi Symphony, and the only line-in option seems to be the CD charger connector in the trunk :-(</p>

<p>Unless I&#8217;m missing something, the SiK device only adds a power-supply to what a simple cable will provide, anyway, right?</p>

<p>You may be looking at the wrong end of the CD changer cable. :-)</p>

<p>You are essentially right auf the SiK device. You want a dock connector on one end and power + line-in on the other end.</p>
