<p>So, <a href="http://www.sixapart.com/corner/archives/2004/05/movable_type_de.shtml">MovableType 3.0</a> is available, it&#8217;ll cost money, and Mena&#8217;s post is the one with the most trackbacks I have ever seen &#8212; and nearly all of them negative.</p>

<p>Big deal, people. Grow up.</p>

<p>I will stick with 2.661 for the foreseeable future, mostly because of MT-Blacklist, the concept of which I find strongly preferable to TypeKey; but if I don&#8217;t switch to MT 3.0, it won&#8217;t be because of the money.</p>
