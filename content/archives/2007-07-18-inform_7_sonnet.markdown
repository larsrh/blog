<p><a href="http://nbhorvath.blogspot.com/2006/12/inform-7-code-poem-challenge.html#c4436199785430035820">A sonnet by Robin Johnson</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Will&#8217;s Study is a room. The desk is here.<br />A hastily handwritten note is on it.<br />Description is &#8220;It&#8217;s from your friend Shakespeare:<br />&#8216;I&#8217;ve gone to lunch. You&#8217;ll have to write the sonnet.&#8217;&#8221;<br />Composing is an action applying to nothing.<br />The quill is a thing that is in the study.<br />Understand &#8220;write sonnet&#8221; as composing.<br />Description of the quill is &#8220;Old and cruddy&#8221;.<br />Instead of composing when the player<br />has no quill, say &#8220;You have not got the quill.&#8221;<br />Instead of composing, say &#8220;And&#8230; done. &#8216;Heya&#8217;,<br />says Will, returning. You say, &#8216;Hello, Will!&#8217;<br />Says Shakespeare, &#8216;Thank you for the time you&#8217;ve taken!<br />You really are a pal, Sir Francis Bacon.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
