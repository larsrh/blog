<p>Mark Baker has written an <a href="http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/wlg/3998">article on his O&#8217;Reilly weblog</a>, and <a href="http://www.markbaker.ca/2002/09/Blog//2003/11/24#2003-11-doc-web">says</a>:</p>

<blockquote>If this doesn&#8217;t convince you, I don&#8217;t know what will.</blockquote>

<p>I hate to say it - but this article is just crap. When I initially subscribed to Mark&#8217;s blog, I did so because he was frequently mentioned as a well-known REST proponent. Following his writings, I got the feeling that either I am simply too dumb to understand all the references to some greater, hidden, from his point of view, obvious things; or alternatively, there is nothing deep hidden beneath the shell he creates.</p>

<p>I have long suspected so, but now I am finally convinced that in Mark&#8217;s case, the emperor really has no clothes.</p>

<p>Yes, the emperor really has no clothes.  You&#8217;ve just got your emperors confused.</p>
