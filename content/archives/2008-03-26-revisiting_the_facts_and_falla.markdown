<p><a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/001083.html">Jeff Atwood</a> about Robert L. Glass's book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0321117425/codinghorror-20" title="Facts and Fallacies of Software Engineering">Facts and Fallacies of Software Engineering</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Even without any of the background discussion and explanation in the book, it's therapeutic to ponder the brief one sentence summaries presented in the table of contents. As you read these, what comes to mind, based on your experience?</p>

<p>I admit I've never heard of this book, but it sounds like it should be required reading (in a Design Patterns, Mythical Man Month, Pragmatic Programmer, Release It! kind of way).</p>
