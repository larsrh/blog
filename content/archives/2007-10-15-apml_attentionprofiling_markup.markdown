<blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.apml.org/">APML</a> allows users to share their own personal Attention Profile in much the same way that OPML allows the exchange of reading lists between News Readers. The idea is to compress all forms of Attention Data into a portable file format containing a description of ranked user interests.</p>
