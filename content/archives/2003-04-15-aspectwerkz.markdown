<p>AspectWerkz is a dynamic, lightweight and high-performant AOP/AOSD framework for Java. </p>

<p>What I really like about its concepts is the option to run it in a mode where it will instrument classes on the fly, as they are loaded. It's also nice that it doesn't require any addition to the Java language (like aspectJ does).</p>
