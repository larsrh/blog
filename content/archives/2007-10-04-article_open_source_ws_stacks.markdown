<p>I&#8217;ve put up <a href="http://www.infoq.com/news/2007/10/os-ws-stacks-background">the results of a multi-party email interview</a> I did on InfoQ:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
In addition to the options offered by commercial vendors, there are a number of open source Java frameworks one can choose from. Among the most popular open source stacks for implementing a SOAP/WS-* based solution in the Java space are <a href="http://ws.apache.org/axis2/" title="Apache Axis2 -">Apache Axis2</a>, <a href="http://incubator.apache.org/cxf/" title="Apache CXF - Index">Apache CXF</a>, <a href="http://static.springframework.org/spring-ws/site/" title="Spring Web Services">Spring Web Services</a> and <a href="https://metro.dev.java.net/">Sun&rsquo;s Metro</a>. <br /><br />Stefan Tilkov posed a number of questions to the lead developers of these stacks &ndash; Paul Fremantle (Axis2), Dan Diephouse (CXF), Arjen Poutsma (Spring Web Services), Thomas Diesler (JBossWS) and Kohsuke Kawaguchi (Metro) &ndash; about their design goals, their approach towards Java and Web services standards, data binding, accessing XML, interoperability, REST support, and framework maturity:</p>
<ol>
<li>Can you describe the main design goals of &quot;your&quot; framework? What do you perceive as its main strengths and unique features?</li>
<li>What&#8217;s your position on and the framework&#8217;s support for JCP standards such as JAX-WS, JAX-RPC, JAXM, JAXB? Why is support for it included/not included?</li>
<li>What Web services standards do you support, and why are those you don&#8217;t support not supported (i.e. do you plan to include them later, not at all, &#8230;)</li>
<li>What&#8217;s your position with regards to data binding and the problems many people associate with it? Do you support native access to the XML message, an XML/object mapping, or both?</li>
<li>How well do you support interoperability with other WS implementations, particularly .NET/WCF?</li>
<li>What is your position with regards to REST? Do you offer any kind of REST support?</li>
<li>What is your framework&#8217;s maturity? Are there any case studies you can point to, are there any commercial or open source products that rely on it?</li>
</ol>
<p>As was to be expected, the results revealed many similarities and some noteworthy differences &ndash; <a href="http://www.infoq.com/news/2007/10/os-ws-stacks-background">see the full article for details</a>.</p>
