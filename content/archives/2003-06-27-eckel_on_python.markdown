<p>Bill Venners interviews Bruce Eckel on <a href="http://www.artima.com/intv/prodperf.html" title="The Zen of Python">The Zen of Python</a>. I have spend quite a lot of time talking to people about the pros and cons of dynamic (scripting) vs. statically typed languages, so this makes a very interesting read.</p>
