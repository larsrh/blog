<p>So, I took Mike up on his <a href="http://fuzzypanic.blogspot.com/2007/12/job-opportunity.html">offer</a>. Starting this coming Monday, January 7th, 2008, I will be a full time employee of <a href="http://www.csinitiative.com/index.php">Collaborative Software Initiative</a>. </p>

<p>This was not a terribly easy decision to make because at virtually the same time that I was talking to Mike, Burton Group, my current employer, asked me to step up to an analyst position and help make 2008 the year of REST. </p>

<p>Anyway, congrats &#8212; check out CSI&#8217;s business model; this seems like a great idea.</p>

<p>Thanks for the sentiments, Stefan.  And if Burton Group is for real on the REST thing, and I think they are, then they will back fill me with someone equally or more capable.  As it is, I gave them a recommendation on who would make an ideal RESTful analyst.  Don&#8217;t know if he&#8217;s looking.  Don&#8217;t know if he&#8217;s interested.  But he would be better suited to it than I.  We&#8217;ll see.</p>
