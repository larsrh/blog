          <h1>Hibernate Trademark</h1>

	  <p><a href="http://blogs.tedneward.com/CommentView,guid,cb561282-8bf8-4a69-aa24-69870b790a65.aspx">Ted Neward</a> cites a letter sent out by RedHat attorneys to someone offering Hibernate training:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Red Hat, Inc. has become aware that your company is offering Hibernate training courses. Red Hat does not allow the use of its trademarks without a written agreement.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Ted is absolutely right to consider this idiotic (and the commenters on his blog, at least the first six, are just dumb), but Ted also misses one point: This is not at all related to RedHat. In fact JBoss, Inc. used <a href="/blog/st/2005/10/07/jboss_madness.html">the same strategy</a> long before.</p>

<p>Oh yes, and before I get the same kind of comments here: They key is not that they need to protect their trademark, which is perfectly fine. If they sent a letter saying you need to refer to &#8220;Hibernate&#8221; as &#8220;Hibernate&trade;&#8221;, that would be perfectly fine. The key is this:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Red Hat does not allow the use of its trademarks without a written agreement. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>That&#8217;s just stupid, because they can stop you from selling your own OR mapper as &#8220;Hibernate&#8221;, but they can&#8217;t stop you from selling &#8220;Training for Hibernate&trade;&#8221;.</p>
