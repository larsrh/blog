<p>Some more thoughts on <a href="http://groovy.codehaus.org">Groovy</a> from <a href="http://www.dehora.net/journal/archives/000342.html">Bill de hOra</a>. He links to an interesting <a href="http://www.softwarecraftsmen.com/blog/archives/000024.html">discussion</a> that questions the need for yet another language. To me, the most interesting things about Groovy are </p>

<ul>
<li>It supports all (or most) of the features one expects from a dynamic language</li>
<li>It relies on the most powerful set of libraries that exists (the J2{S|E} platform)</li>
<li>It has a pretty clean and familiar syntax (at least of Java developers)</li>
</ul>
