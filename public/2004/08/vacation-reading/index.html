	  <p>I just returned from a 10 day vacation, and the fact that I was only online through my cell phone&#8217;s GPRS connection explains why it&#8217;s been awfully quiet here. Now back with 1.5 weeks of somehow not working to go, and with a broadband connection again, I can restart the blogging habit. It&#8217;ll take me a while to get through the 1040 unread posts in my newsreader, but at least I won&#8217;t have a shortage of stuff to write about &#8230;</p>

<p>As usual, I took a bunch of books along on our trip. This time, I decided to dig a bit deeper into functional programming (it&#8217;s vacation, not work, you know?), so I brought some more or less theoretical stuff. First of all, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0262541483">The Scheme Programming Language</a>, by R. Kent Dybvig, is <em>the</em> authorative work on Scheme, comparable to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0131103628">Kernighan Ritchie</a> for C or <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0201700735">Stroustrup</a> for C++. And much like them, it&#8217;s a book that gets a lot of praise, a book that can&#8217;t be avoided if you want to seriously explore the language, and a book that I don&#8217;t think anyone will really benefit from unless they already know the language. I knew some Lisp and Scheme before, and expected to finally really gain some understanding about more advanced topics, such as continuations, but was a bit disappointed.</p>

<p>I liked <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0201700735">Essentials of Programming Languages</a> by Friedman et. al. much better. (Of course the two are not directly comparable, since they cover different topics; I mean this in a more abstract way.) The authors explore programming language concepts, such as data abstraction, types, objects and classes, continuations and continuation-passing style, using Scheme as the language to implement interpreters for languages that support these concepts. Very interesting, and much recommended.</p>

<p>Rather introductory, but still very much worth its money for me was <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0262011530">Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs</a>, by Abelson and Sussman (also available <a href="http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/full-text/book/book-Z-H-4.html#%25_toc_start">online</a>, thanks, <a href="/blog/st/2004/08/18/vacation_reading.html#comments">J&#246;rg</a>). This book is the basis for MIT&#8217;s introductory computer science course &#8212; to me, pretty clearly demonstrating why MIT has such a great reputation. The most interesting aspect apart from looking at things from a fresh, functional perspective, was the chapter on Metalinguistic Abstraction. Highly recommended, whether you have programming background or not. </p>

<p>Apart from a whole bunch of novels (which I&#8217;ll comment on later), Paul Graham&#8217;s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0596006624">Hackers and Painters: Big Ideas from the Computer Age</a> made for some great reading in between &#8212; with a range of diverse topics, from education to business to technology, it&#8217;s never boring although you might not agree with him all of the time.</p>
