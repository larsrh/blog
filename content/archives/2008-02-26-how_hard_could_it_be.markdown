<blockquote>
<p>Just because they say you&#8217;re crazy doesn&#8217;t mean you&#8217;re not crazy. Yes, things that seem impossible can be great innovations. On the other hand, they simply may be impossible. But on those rare occasions when you realize that something nobody thinks can work really can work&#8212;well, on that day, you just might change the world.</p>
