<p><a href="http://www.propylon.com/news/ctoarticles/040608_email.html">Sean questions</a> the validity of the email paradigm in an age where you could simply publish URIs that allow people to access the stuff intended for them instead &#8230; I remember that &#8212; with smaller scale, of course &#8212; Lotus Notes had (and still has) a feature called &#8220;shared mail&#8221;, enabling you to avoid useless copying and keep references to email documents instead. I also remembered that the one time my former company enabled it, it worked great for some time &#8212; until the first system crash <em>not affecting your machine at all</em> took away data that was so transparently stored elsewhere you never noticed.</p>
