<p><a href="http://skonnard.com/archive/2004/03/18/290.aspx">Aaron Skonnard</a> writes about Infopath&#8217;s new features (currently in preview). It seems the InfoPath guys even have their own <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/infopath/">weblog</a>.</p>

<p>I really like the InfoPath concept. Too bad there&#8217;s nothing comparable for my <a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/">operating system of choice</a>.</p>
