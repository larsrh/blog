<p>An <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/enterprise-information-integration/message/24=">utterly brilliant article</a> by <a href="http://seanmcgrath.blogspot.com/">Sean McGrath</a>. Incidentally, I see this when I&#8217;m in the middle of a very interesting e-mail discussion regarding my <a href="/blog/st/archives/000642.html">own post</a> regarding XML and typing.</p>

<p>Hi Stefan,
I&#8217;ve been reading the Sean&#8217;s article&#8230; Still I think we missed something. All the time we speak about static and dynamic typing pointing to runtime problems. Isn&#8217;t the real devil hiddned in static and dynamic compilation instead of typing? You know, I&#8217;ve heared a lot of arguments, but most of them finished on a compilation argument.</p>

<p>Best, Tobbi</p>
