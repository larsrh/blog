<p>The <a href="http://www.PetitionOnline.com/vmwarosx/petition.html">petition for a Mac/Intel version of VMware</a> is coming along nicely &#8212; but could still definitely use some more publicity. So if you have any interest in being able to run XP, Linux or any other PC operating system in a VM under Mac OS X, <em>without <a href="http://www.sauria.com/blog/2006/01/24#1465">the ridiculous dual-boot hassle</a></em>, please consider to not only sign the petition, but also provide a link on your own blog.</p>
