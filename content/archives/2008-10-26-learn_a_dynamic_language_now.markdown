<blockquote>
<p>Having spent the last 8 months working with Ruby and dabbling with Python, I just can't look at C# or Java code the same way. There's so much more of it than there needs to be. It's just like the step from C++ up to those languages, details that are unnecessary for most developers were removed and everything got simpler, leaving you to focus on solving your problem. So it is with this next step up to dynamic languages.</p>

<p>One probably shouldn&#8217;t – I just mentioned this because Tim has always been a hard-core C#/WSDL/SOAP/XML guy to me.</p>
