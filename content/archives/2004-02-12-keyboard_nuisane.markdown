<p>It seems the letter is broken on my keyboard. Given that it doesn&#8217;t our that muh in the English language, that doesn&#8217;t seem to be too bad. It suks, though. Fuk.
[Update: OK, after fiddling around some, I have my &#8216;c&#8217; back, which is nice. If you&#8217;re into really strange things, there&#8217;s whole novels that avoid letters. There&#8217;s even one (originally written in French) that does not contain the letter &#8216;e&#8217; - you can find out more about that <a href="http://www.linguistlist.org/issues/11/11-1701.html">here</a> or read <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0465086454">my favorite book</a>.]</p>
