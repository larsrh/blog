<p>There&#8217;s little doubt that <a href="http://whytheluckystiff.net/">Why</a> is a strange person, and his <a href="http://poignantguide.net/">poignant guide to Ruby</a> will seem weird to most people &#8212; but this <a href="http://tryruby.hobix.com/">online interactive browser-based Ruby tutorial</a> is very cool. (He also maintains a very interesting <a href="http://redhanded.hobix.com/">blog</a>, BTW.)</p>
