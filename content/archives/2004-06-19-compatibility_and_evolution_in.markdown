<p><a href="http://www.manageability.org/blog/stuff/compatibility-in-a-asynchronous-world">Carlos Perez</a>, whose site I can only recommend by heart, writes about the applicability of the <a href="http://www.brent.worden.org/articles/2000/liskovSubstitutionPrinciple.html">Liskov Substitution Principle</a>, <a href="http://archive.eiffel.com/doc/manuals/technology/contract/">Design by Contract</a> and <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=Postel's+law&#38;">Postel&#8217;s Law</a> in the context of an SOA:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>What I can&#8217;t get a handle on is that these principles and guidelines seem to be have an assumption of a client and server relationship. This is a consequence of its synchronous procedure call roots. That is, in a peer-to-peer relationship, shouldn&#8217;t the pre and post conditions be symmetric? If that were so, wouldn&#8217;t compatibility be much more restrictive? That is you can only be conservative in all your communication since everyone is equally a sender?</p>
