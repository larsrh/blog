<p><a href="http://www.neward.net/ted/weblog/index.jsp?date=20050525%231117011754831">Ted Neward</a> writes about &#8220;Web&#8221; and &#8220;Services&#8221; and the fact that in his opinion two concepts are mixed in the term. I agree, but I&#8217;d object to this:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>For example, interoperability is easy if we use text-based protocols, since everybody knows how to read and write text; hence, HTTP and SMTP and POP3 are highly-interoperable protocols, but DCOM&#8217;s MEOW or Java&#8217;s JRMP protocols aren&#8217;t, since each relies on sending binary little-endian or big-endian-encoded data. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>That&#8217;s one difference, but not the only one &#8212; HTTP is simply on another layer than JRMP, and it&#8217;s its genericity that makes it so useful even when exchanging binary data.</p>
