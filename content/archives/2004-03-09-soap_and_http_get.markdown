<p>An <a href="http://www-106.ibm.com/developerworks/xml/library/x-tipgetr.html?ca=drs-x1004">interesting DeveloperWorks article</a>  about the SOAP 1.2 support for HTTP GET, and <a href="http://webpages.charter.net/chrisfer/archives/2004_03_01_oldrants.html#107865506335322033">some comments from Chris Ferris</a>. I don&#8217;t agree with all of them; e.g. I think if you are using a Web services toolkit, you are going to want to use it for all kinds of requests, and not have different implementation technologies for different semantics.</p>
