<p>I am not competent enough to have a real opinion on <a href="http://realtech.burningbird.net/web/page-markups/battle-beliefs-rdf-and-natural-language-processing-and-future-web">the issues</a>. But it seems to me that if HTML, and HTTP and the Web as a whole had ever been under the same level of scrutiny as RDFa is, the Web's success would <em>never</em> have happened.</p>

<p>The potential cost of including it seems to me to be much less that the potential cost of the lost opportunity.</p>
