<blockquote>
<p>There has been a great deal of interest in closures lately, driven in great part by the fact that there is talk of adding some form of anonymous functions to the Java. Most of the time, people talk about &#8220;adding closures&#8221; to Java, and that prompts a flurry of questions of the form &#8220;what is a closure and why should I care?&#8221;</p>
