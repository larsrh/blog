<p>From <a href="http://www.25hoursaday.com/weblog/PermaLink.aspx?guid=626cc953-4e94-45b2-a7e5-7e1c4d695ee7">Dare Obsanjo</a> comes a quote that, although from a WinFS context, fits my <a href="/blog/st/2004/06/java_objects_and_xml.html">previous post</a> perfectly:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The  main problem with using objects to program against XML is that although objects work  well for programming against data-centric XML (rigidly structured tabular data&#160;such  as an the data in an Excel spreadsheet,&#160;a database dump or serialized objects)  there is a signficant impedance mismatch when trying to use strongly typed objects  to program against document-centric XML (semi-structured data such as a Word document).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#8217;d expand this to say that this is not only true for Word documents, but for any sort of business document regardless of the application it has been created with.</p>
