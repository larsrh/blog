<p>Extremely cool:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><a href="http://gears.google.com/">Google Gears</a> (BETA) is an open source browser extension that enables web applications to provide offline functionality using following JavaScript APIs:
</p><ul>
<li>Store and serve application resources locally</li>
<li>Store data locally in a fully-searchable relational database</li>
<li>Run asynchronous Javascript to improve application responsiveness</li>
</ul><ul>

</ul></blockquote>

<p>From the <a href="http://code.google.com/support/bin/answer.py?answer=69197&amp;topic=11629" title="Developer Knowledge Base
- What is Google Gears?">FAQ</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Gears provides three key features:
</p><ul>
<li>A local server, to cache and serve application resources (HTML, JavaScript, images, etc.) without needing to contact a server</li>
<li>A database, to store and access data from within the browser</li>
<li>A worker thread pool, to make web applications more responsive by performing expensive operations in the background</li>
</ul><ul>

</ul></blockquote>

<p>The database is <a href="http://www.sqlite.org/" title="SQLite home page">SQLite</a>, everything is access though JavaScript. BSD-licensed.</p>
