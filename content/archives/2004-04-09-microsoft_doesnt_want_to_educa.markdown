<p>Here&#8217;s a question for <a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0001011/">Robert Scoble</a>, let&#8217;s see if he&#8217;s able to pick it up: I have <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/mac/products/internetexplorer/internetexplorer.aspx?pid=internetexplorer">Microsoft Internet Explorer</a> and <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/windowsmedia/software/Macintosh/osx/default.aspx">Windows Media Player</a> installed. I also run <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/windowsmedia/software/Macintosh/osx/default.aspx">Microsoft Office</a>. Sadly, that doesn&#8217;t seem to suffice to be able to watch the presentations from the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/architecture/overview/series/">.NET architecture overview series</a>. How do you expect to evangelize people using other platforms when they can&#8217;t view content - even if they&#8217;re on a <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/mac/">supported platform</a>? The same goes for things like <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyId=04AE4298-0D86-4CE7-92CA-6AB9921742E1&#38;displaylang=en#filelist">this</a>:</p>

<blockquote>To view the demo only as a standalone .wmv file, choose the file 20040408VisualCKGDemo.exe</blockquote>

<p>Why hide a <code>wmv</code> inside an executable? What&#8217;s wrong with plain old <code>Zip</code> file format?</p>

<p>Seriously, if anybody can <a href="mailto:stefan.tilkov@innoq.com">send me</a> the URI of the media stream for the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/architecture/overview/series/">Technology Roadmap</a> presentation that has got to be hidden somewhere inside that JavaScript/DHTML mess, that would be just great.</p>
