<p><a href="http://www.pacificspirit.com/blog/2007/04/19/what_do_version_identifiers_identify">Dave Orchard</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The fundamental problem with a version # in a document is that it doesn&#8217;t provide for a given document to be valid under more than one version. What we really need is to be able to indicate a &#8220;space of versions&#8221; that a given document is valid under, whether that&#8217;s a list or regexp or whatever.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Dave&#8217;s writing on versioning is great; I hope he&#8217;ll turn it into a book one day.</p>

<p>If by &#8220;version number&#8221; you mean that a document follows a certain schema, you get jclark&#8217;s latest post: &#8220;Validity should be treated not as a property of a document but as a relationship between a document and a schema.&#8221;</p>
