<p>WSO2&#8217;s developer portal <a href="http://wso2.org/library/1078">has published an interview</a> with <a href="http://auburnmarshes.spaces.live.com/">Jonathan Marsh</a> about the <a href="http://wso2.org/projects/mashup">WSO2 Mashup Server</a>. I&#8217;m tempted to look at this &#8212; but haven&#8217;t even checked the Synapse stuff yet (another, unrelated, todo on my &#8220;possibly cool things to look at&#8221; list).</p>

<p><em>Update</em>: This <a href="http://www.bloglines.com/blog/sanjiva?id=203">is based</a> on <a href="http://incubator.apache.org/abdera/">Apache Abdera</a> (as was to be expected).</p>
