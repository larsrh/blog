<p>Not that it has ever disappeared, but I can&#8217;t help but notice that the good old C programming language is becoming a serious option to Web developers again &#8212; witness Tim Bray&#8217;s <a href="http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2007/06/25/mod_atom">mod_atom</a>, an implementation of the Atom Publishing Protocol as an Apache HTTPD Module, or the NY Times&#8217; DB implementation called <a href="http://code.nytimes.com/projects/dbslayer">DBSlayer</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The DBacesslayer aka DBSlayer aka Sl&#228;yer (as we like to call it when we&#8217;re feeling ironically heavy metal) is a lightweight database abstraction layer suitable for high-load websites where you need the scalable advantages of connection pooling. Written in C for speed, DBSlayer talks to clients via JSON over HTTP, meaning it&#8217;s simple to monitor and can swiftly interoperate with any web framework you choose.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It seems wire protocols, preferably those of the Web, are the new standard to meet to build &#8220;components&#8221; that are usable anywhere &#8230;</p>
