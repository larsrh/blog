<blockquote>
<p>Yesterday, Marcel Molina Jr. of 37signals (and member of the Rails core-team) announced the initial release of AWS::S3, a ruby library for Amazon&#8217;s Simple Store Service&#8217;s (S3) REST API. Marcel was nice enough to share insight into the motivations and history behind his promising new library with InfoQ. We think his answers cast light into how Amazon&#8217;s web services are transforming the industry.</p>
