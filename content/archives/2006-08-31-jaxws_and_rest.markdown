<p><a href="http://java.sun.com/developer/technicalArticles/WebServices/restful/">An article at sun.com</a> describes how to use JAX-WS to build a RESTful HTTP app. There are some small issues, like the mismatch between the table once again making the dreaded CRUD comparison, or suggesting to put the verb in the URL, or misunderstanding caching, but other than that, it&#8217;s interesting &#8212; if only to note that using JAX-WS to build a RESTful application seems to have zero benefit over sticking with the Servlet API.</p>
