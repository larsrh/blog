<blockquote>I think the future is clear, and it ain&#8217;t spelled &#8220;XSD&#8221;. Major recent RELAX NG wins include DocBook, OpenOffice, XHTML, and SVG; all of which are planning to move to RELAX NG in their next versions. I have yet to encounter a group that seriously explored RELAX NG and still chose to use the W3C XML Schema Language</blockquote>

<p>I have only taken a casual look at RELAX NG, but I clearly like it a lot better than XSD. Now if it would only be acknowledged in the Web services world &#8230;</p>

<p>Looking at the examples in the RELAX NG Tutorial, <a href="http://www.relaxng.org/tutorial-20011203.html," rel="nofollow" /><a href="http://www.relaxng.org/tutorial-20011203.html," rel="nofollow">http://www.relaxng.org/tutorial-20011203.html,</a> it seems to have one really big disadvantage: it&#8217;s impossible to read.</p>

<p>I can take in the DTDs with a glance, but I really have to work hard to understand the equivalent RELAX NG.</p>

<p>Neil, take a look at the compact syntax:</p>

<p><em>Much</em> easier to read that either DTDs or XSDs, IMO. Another good example is Tim Bray&#8217;s Pie schema (back when Atom was called Pie) - <a href="http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2003/07/09/PieSchema01" rel="nofollow" /><a href="http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2003/07/09/PieSchema01" rel="nofollow">http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2003/07/09/PieSchema01</a> .</p>
