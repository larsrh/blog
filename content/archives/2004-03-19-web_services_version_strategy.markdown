<p><a href="http://webpages.charter.net/chrisfer">Chris Ferris</a> (whom I sadly can&#8217;t link to correctly, since his RSS feed does not include the permalink to his entry and his blog is next to  unnavigable) points to <a href="http://sdec.reach.ie/rigs/rig0006">a very well designed services/messages versioning policy</a> (it seems <a href="http://seanmcgrath.blogspot.com/archives/2004_03_14_seanmcgrath_archive.html#107934891561599510">Sean McGrath</a> had his hands in it).</p>
