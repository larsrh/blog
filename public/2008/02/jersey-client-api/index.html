<p>This API was originally being used for Jersey unit testing but i think it is applicable in the larger context of a general RESTful client API.</p>

<p>I find the use of the method name &#8220;proxy&#8221; slightly unfortunate &#8212; other than that, I like this very much.</p>

<p>Hi Stefan,</p>

<p>I am not a great fan of proxy either, too close to CORBA perhaps :-) I fully admit to struggling to come up with something better. Resource on it&#8217;s own seems a bit overloaded in Java. ResourceReference feels too long. Perhaps ResourceRef? Do you have any suggestions?</p>

<p>Paul.</p>

<p>Yeah, criticizing is easy until you&#8217;re asked to come up with a better proposal :-) &#8220;ResourceRef&#8221; doesn&#8217;t sound too bad to me. How about HttpResource? Or maybe WebResource?</p>

<p>I think i am sold on WebResource! There is a nice parallel with using an annotation say called @WebResourceRef for an injection target of WebResource instances.</p>

<p>I will hold off renaming just yet so as not to confuse others who may be looking at the API, but i will definitely make the change in the next week or two.</p>

<p>Thanks,
Paul.</p>
