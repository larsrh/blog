<p>Together with <a href="http://it-and-more.blogspot.com/">Dr. Gernot Starke</a>, I&#8217;m happy to chair the 4-day SOA track at <a href="http://www.sigs-datacom.de/sd/kongresse/oop_2006/index.php?cat=oop_2007_c4p">next year&#8217;s OOP 2007 conference</a> which takes place from January 22-26 in Munich, Germany. Please see <a href="http://www.sigs-datacom.de/sd/kongresse/oop_2006/index.php?cat=oop_2007_c4p">the call for papers</a> for details about submitting an abstract. Note that we&#8217;re happy about English as well as German presentation proposals. The deadline is July 1st (!), so hurry up :-)</p>
