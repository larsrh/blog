<p>From <a href="http://www.davidchappell.com/HTML_email/Opinari_No9_01_04.html#article1" title="David Chappell :: Opinari">David Chappell</a> (the west coast/.NET one):</p>

<blockquote>Earlier in my career, I spent several years giving seminars on OSI. Since I once helped spread this false gospel, I feel a special responsibility to root out its remaining pernicious effects. Please join my campaign. Together, we can kill this seven-layered beast.</blockquote>

<p>Amen to that.</p>
