<blockquote>
<p>As an aside, it&#8217;s fascinating to watch REST awareness grow amongst enterprise technologists. I await the day when an enterprise architect lectures me in a meeting on not getting the REST style; as opposed to being dismissed as a fool for suggesting it (as might have happened any time in the last 6/7 years when WS-* and SOA represented orthodoxy).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I just recently read an article that aimed to shed light on the &#8220;SOAP vs. REST&#8221; debate &#8212; concluding that it&#8217;s the wrong one to have because both are OK, but &#8220;the real problem is HTTP&#8221;.</p>
