<p>I just have to get this off my chest, quickly, before I choke on it: Struts, probably the most widely used Java web application framework in the world, has got to be the most useless, time-wasting, confusing, bloated piece of crap I&#8217;ve ever encountered. In any programming language.</p>

<p>The pure horror of XML configuration file hell, mile-long stack traces, brain-dead pseudo-functionality, and the fact that I&#8217;ve wasted the last few hours of my life on implementing something that would have taken me about 3.5 minutes with something like <a href="http://www.rubyonrails.org/">Rails</a> and maybe 30 minutes with a damn 50 line CGI script written in Perl, convinces me that Struts is the best way to drive Java programmers to switch to something more productive.</p>

<p>I have found another useless tool in the last days which wasted so many time of my live: Hibernate! Why  do we must have just another OO/ER-persitency layer. I feel that I have made e time leap back for 7 years when I was using TopLink or CocoBase.
Why there is such a Hibernate-Hype?</p>
