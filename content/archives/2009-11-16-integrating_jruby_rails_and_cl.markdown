<p>I&#8217;ve played a little bit with integrating Clojure and Rails (via JRuby). This is all very rudimentary, check out the repository at <a href="http://github.com/stilkov/jruby-rails-clojure">GitHub</a>. </p>

<p>Really nice combination, Stefan. I&#8217;ve been wanting to play with these tools for some time and haven&#8217;t found time. So much work on &#8220;other&#8221; things. I&#8217;ll take a look.</p>
