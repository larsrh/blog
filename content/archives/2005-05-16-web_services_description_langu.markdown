<p>Mmm&#8230; Don&#8217;t find it very encouraging&#8230; I wonder&#8230; when Web Services will be left as unmanageable and come back to fix the issues CORBA had and start to program seriously?  How is that this article don&#8217;t cover CORBA IDL? Isn&#8217;t it that also suited for describing services? Believe me, people is using it day by day to do this&#8230;</p>
