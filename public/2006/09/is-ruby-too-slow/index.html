<p>Ruby is obviously a lot slower than many other languages. That&#8217;s not the point. The major point is whether that maters. </p>

<p>The shootout doesn&#8217;t prove anything, IMO, since a Web app &#8212; the target of Rails &#8212; spends most of its time waiting on either the network or the DB. I&#8217;ve not yet seen a Ruby on Rails app that failed because of performance issues, and I don&#8217;t really expect to see one anytime soon.</p>

<p>Joel is talking <em>specifically</em> about Ruby, not Rails. Ruby IS slow, fullstop.
This may be secondary in webapps, but is still a matter of fact.
This also means that Java is the best thing could happen to Ruby: rumors says that the JRuby implementation will be faster than the original c implementation.</p>
