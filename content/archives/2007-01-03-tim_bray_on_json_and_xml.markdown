<p><a href="http://pluralsight.com/blogs/dbox/archive/2007/01/03/45560.aspx">Don Box</a> wonders about several things addressed in <a href="http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2006/12/21/JSON">Tim Bray&#8217;s XML vs. JSON post</a>. Don surely hasn&#8217;t been working on Indigo/WCF for quite some time &#8212; I wonder what his current job is? :-)</p>
