<p>Excellent answer from <a href="http://norman.walsh.name/2008/05/13/thetax">Norm Walsh</a> to Jeff Atwood's <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/001114.html">XML criticism</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I don't necessarily think all the alternatives to XML suck, but the mindless, knee-jerk rejection of XML because it contains a small amount of additional syntax certainly does. Like all tools, it's a question of how you use it. Please think twice before subjecting yourself, your fellow programmers, and your users to more fragile, ASCII-only, ad hoc syntaxes.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is an occasion where I agree that both alternatives (XML and more light-weight approaches) are worth being considered.</p>
