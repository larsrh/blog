<p>As an aside, it&#8217;s fascinating to watch REST awareness grow amongst enterprise technologists. I await the day when an enterprise architect lectures me in a meeting on not getting the REST style; as opposed to being dismissed as a fool for suggesting it (as might have happened any time in the last 6/7 years when WS-* and SOA represented orthodoxy).</p>
