<p><a href="http://www.snellspace.com/wp/?p=668">James Snell</a> points to <a href="http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/xml/library/x-atomencryption/">this developerWorks article</a> by Nick Case which shows how to encrypt and sign Atom entries using <a href="http://incubator.apache.org/abdera/">Apache Abdera</a>; <a href="http://wanderingbarque.com/nonintersecting/2007/05/25/message-level-security-and-rest/">Pete Lacey correctly notes</a> that this addresses RESTful HTTP&#8217;s perceived message-level security shortcoming (and also shows how to use WSS authentication). </p>

<p>As <a href="http://www.infoq.com/articles/mark-baker-REST">Mark Baker put it</a> a while ago:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>For what it&#8217;s worth, I believed until quite recently that SOAP was salvageable as a generic XML envelope. But I think Atom has quietly usurped that role while SOAP was distracted being used for RPC.</p>
