<p>I&#8217;m not sure anyone cares about my opinion in this particular discussion, but I agree 100% with <a href="http://www.cincomsmalltalk.com/blog/blogView?showComments=true&amp;entry=3329497100">James Robertson&#8217;s view</a> (who references <a href="http://www.unto.net/unto/work/on-rss-and-atom/">this post by DeWitt Clinton</a>): If you need to provide content syndication features in any form, you should definitely go with <a href="http://www.atomenabled.org/developers/syndication/">Atom</a> (which is <a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4287.txt">an IETF standard</a>), not RSS (which is, technically speaking, crap). <a href="http://atom.geekhood.net/atom2rss.xsl">Convert</a> as needed.</p>

<p>In case you wonder why RSS hasn&#8217;t been &#8220;fixed&#8221;, James provides the answer:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>RSS could have been the unitary spec had Dave not been a complete jerk, and people like Scoble bear some responsibility for that by never, ever calling him on his BS.</p>
