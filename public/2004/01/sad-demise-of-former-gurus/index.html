	  <p>I used to hold Robert Martin in high esteem - back in the days when I was still doing C++, and his was a very pragmatic approach to OOP. But <a href="http://www.artima.com/weblogs/viewpost.jsp?thread=27269">crap like this</a> has made me change my mind.
Take this, for example (on Web services):</p>

<blockquote>Of course it couldn&#8217;t be just remote procedure call. It had to be remote object invocation! We can&#8217;t just have functions and procedures, we&#8217;ve got to have objects. Functions are just to passe. Objects are where it&#8217;s at. </blockquote>

<p>Oh my &#8230; what has this got to do with reality? Who claims that Web services has got anything to do with objects?
Robert: Get a clue.</p>
