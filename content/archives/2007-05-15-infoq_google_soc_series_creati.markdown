<blockquote>
<p>A detailed specification is necessary for all implementers of Ruby runtimes. Currently, to make a Ruby runtime compatible to the official Ruby provided by Yukihiro Matsumoto,&#160; the implementers have to check the C code to see what it does or, if that&#8217;s not possible, simply ask Matz or the Ruby community how something is supposed to work. With more and more Ruby versions around (JRuby, Rubinius, MS IronRuby, etc.), there&#8217;s a need for a formal specification. Even better if the specification is actually executable code instead of pages of prose. Two Google SoC projects aim to fix this problem by creating RSpec specifications for Ruby.</p>
