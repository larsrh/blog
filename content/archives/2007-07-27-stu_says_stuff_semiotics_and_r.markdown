<p><a href="http://www.stucharlton.com/blog/archives/000154.html">Excellent stuff from Stuart Charlton</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I think the biggest confusion about REST is that it&#8217;s not a protocol, it&#8217;s a way to think about extremely big information systems. To compare prior models with REST, one has to think about the problem of information management &#38; manipulation in network.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Referring to Pat Helland&#8217;s data on the inside/data on the outside article, Stu points out how, similarly to a service in SOA, a resource in REST can hide implementation details. I emphatically agree &#8212; at least in general, a resource is more than a DB entity with CRUD operations. This is exactly what makes me slightly suspicious of <a href="http://astoria.mslivelabs.com/">implementations</a> that simply expose rows in a DB as resources.</p>
