	  <p>Ted Neward <a href="http://blogs.tedneward.com/2008/01/29/Highlights+Of+The+LangNET+Symposium+Day+One.aspx">wrote about the Lang.NET symposium</a> (sounds like something I would have loved to attend). This quote seems exactly spot on:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Looking at both languages like F# and Scala, for example, we see a definite hybridization of both functional and object languages, and it doesn&#8217;t take much exploration of C#&#8217;s and VB&#8217;s expression trees facility to realize that they&#8217;re already a half-step shy of a full (semantic or syntactic) macro system, something that traditionally has been associated with dynamic languages.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I agree, I&#8217;ll just note that the fact that these features now become part of the mainstream means <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_(programming_language)">any language that doesn&#8217;t have them</a> will feel severely limited. And it seems to me that it&#8217;s awfully hard to bring all of these features together in a way &#8220;normal&#8221; people can understand <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_(programming_language)">if you throw in a real type system</a>.  </p>
