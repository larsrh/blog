<p><a href="http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2008/04/09/Google-Users-API">Tim Bray</a> with a great analogy:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I quote from The Users API on the Google App Engine site:<br /><br /><em>Google App Engine features integration with Google Accounts: Applications can have users sign in using their Google accounts, and know who is using the application during a session. With Google Accounts, your users can get into your application sooner by not having to create a new account, and your application can personalize the user experience without managing its own login system.</em><br /><br />... and now you’re a sharecropper on Massa Google’s plantation.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Very smart move on Google's side. While this is probably perfectly fine for small sites that don't have any larger goals, it's obviously unsuitable for those who want to build a new web business with the goal of selling it to Google later. The question is: will people know which group they belong to?</p>
