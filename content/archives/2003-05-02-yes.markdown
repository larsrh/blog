<p>I watched the movie Almost Famous (which is pretty great, BTW) and came across <a href="http://yesmuseum.org/Healthy73.txt" title="">an article by Cameron Crowe</a> that appeared in Rolling Stone in 1973, when Crowe was 15 (just like the hero in the movie). Apart from being extraordinarly well written, I find it funny that it actually is about one my all-time favorite bands, Yes. <br />
About a year ago, I want to see them in concert; and although some might find it strange that they almost exclusively played tracks from the early 70s, this was exactly what I was looking for. They still are among the best in the world.</p>
