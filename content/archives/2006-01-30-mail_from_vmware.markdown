<p>I sent an email to VMware sales regarding the <a href="http://www.petitiononline.com/vmwarosx/petition.html">OS X Intel version</a> a few days ago &#8230; this just came in:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Dear Stefan Tilkov,
<br />
Thank you for your inquiry. Unfortunately, we do not provide information in
advance of an official press release. My only suggestion is to stay tuned to
our website for further details.
<br />
<br />
Kind Regards,
<br />
Laura Rodriguez
VMware Sales Operations

<p>That does not sound too bad &#8230;</p>
