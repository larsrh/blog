<blockquote>
<p>As of today, DTracing Java is cool as long as you&#8217;re doing relatively general performance analysis of the software - questions about &#8220;which method?&#8221;, &#8220;which class?&#8221;, &#8220;which monitor?&#8221; can be answered - to open the ultimate insight into application space (&#8220;which query?&#8221;, &#8220;which dataset?&#8221;, &#8220;which url?&#8221;) we need to work a little harder.</p>
