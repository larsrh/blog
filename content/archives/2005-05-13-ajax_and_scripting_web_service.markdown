<p>Never mind the AJAX stuff; see <a href="http://www-128.ibm.com/developerworks/webservices/library/ws-ajax1/">part 1</a> and <a href="http://www-128.ibm.com/developerworks/webservices/library/ws-ajax2/">part 2</a> of this introduction to see how easy XML processing can be once you get rid of the (de)serialization idea &#8212; provided your language offers appropriate support.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m firmly convinced that something more or less equivalent to this will be part of mainstream languages one or two years from now. </p>
