I just finished Neal Stephenson&#8217;s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0553380966/randomstuff-21/002-5137311-3124021?%5Fencoding=UTF8&#38;camp=1638&#38;link%5Fcode=xm2">&#8220;The Diamond Age : Or, a Young Lady&#8217;s Illustrated Primer&#8221;</a> &#8212; not only my favorite Neal Stephenson novel so far, but clearly one of the best books I&#8217;ve read in a long time. </p>

<p>Highly recommended.

<p>uuh - quite strong opposition. I tried THAT one a few month ago, due to some enthusiastic recommendations - and was really disappointed. A tightly interwoven net of &#8220;pieces&#8221;, sometimes obscure language - that one is clearly for Stephenson-lovers or insiders.</p>

<p>Maybe it&#8217;s inevitable that you feel this way about the first Neal Stephenson novel you read - I had some doubts with my first one (Cryptonomicon). You get used to it, though (I&#8217;ve read all of them by now) - Stephenson does not write end-to-end stories, but rather collections of ideas and patterns. But those are without competition &#8230;</p>

<p>in my opinion this was one of stephenson&#8217;s weaker offerings. still decent, but i found the didactic elements of the book annoying&#8230;i really didn&#8217;t need to have undergrad compsci weaved so tightly into my plot points. the only other stephenson book i can recommend beyond snow crash is cryptonomicron. stay away from his latest door-stop baroque series, i found those terribly boring.</p>

<p>Whoa! Another violent disagreement &#8212; I enjoyed the Baroque Cycle tremendously :-)</p>
