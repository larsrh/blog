<p>QCon London is coming up …</p>

<p><a href="http://qconlondon.com/london-2009/"><img title="Speaking at Qcon London 09" src="/blog/st/images/Speaking_Qcon_London_01.jpg" border="0" vspace="4" height="144" hspace="4" alt="Speaking at Qcon London 01" width="404" /></a></p>

<p>I'll be hosting <a href="http://qconlondon.com/london-2009/tracks/show_track.jsp?trackOID=222">a track on Real World SOA</a> and give a talk in Dan North's <a href="http://qconlondon.com/london-2009/tracks/show_track.jsp?trackOID=233">architecture track</a> (the topic of the latter hasn't been finally decided yet). The past QCon conferences were truly great – I'm very much looking forward to it.</p>
