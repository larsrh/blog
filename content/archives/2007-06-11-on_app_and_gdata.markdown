<blockquote>
<p>I&#8217;m sorry for the confusion around APP and GData, but I suppose that&#8217;s natural for a relatively new protocol. The good news is that so many people are already shipping APP-based applications, including some pretty big ones from Google. My sense is that the Atom Publishing Protocol is one of those things that will &#8220;just work&#8221; and make the web better, just like HTTP and HTML did. Let&#8217;s not lose sight of that goal, okay?</p>
