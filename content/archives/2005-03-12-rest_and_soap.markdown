<p><a href="http://savas.parastatidis.name/2005/03/12/505b74f7-d5d3-4b94-95d4-65129ce2bf2b.aspx">Savas Parastatidis</a> builds part of the Web on SOAP and concludes:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Both the  REST and WS communities have a lot to learn from each other. We should constructively educate one-another and learn from what &#8216;the other side&#8217; has to say instead of declaring each other&#8217;s demise.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I thought about creating a list of links about the current debate, but I would not be able to add much to <a href="http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2005/03/11/WSInTheSpring">Tim Bray&#8217;s post</a>. </p>

<p>(BTW, to cut off some predictable comments: No, I don&#8217;t believe we <em>should</em> build another Web on top of the existing one; I don&#8217;t think Savas was that serious, either.)</p>
