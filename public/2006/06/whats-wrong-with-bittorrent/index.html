	  <p><a href="http://www.glassdog.com/archives/2006/06/21/whats_wrong_with_bittorrent.html">A great rant about BitTorrent</a> from Lance Arthur:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Don&#8217;t get me wrong. Even considering all the above, BitTorrent is wonderful technology that accomplishes something that is badly needed. But the guts of any project are exactly that, the guts: they&#8217;re ugly to look at, hard to put to use without an interface and not the sort of thing you drag out in polite company. Just like Napster put a pretty face on MP3s (and paved the way for the legal iTunes), the BitTorrent community needs to pull its collective head out of its socket and realize that real people want to accomplish real things with their little toy. And that can&#8217;t happen until they stop playing with it, hose it off and put a pretty pink ribbon around its neck, so it&#8217;s not so scary.</p>
