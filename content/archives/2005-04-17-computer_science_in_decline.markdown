<p>From<a href="http://creativekarma.com/ee.php/weblog/comments/computer_science_in_decline/"> Doug Pardee&#8217;s Creative Karma</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There seems to be a single key factor in what makes a CS technique survive: it has to simplify the programming process. A learning curve is acceptable, but once the technique is learned, it must make the <em>creation</em> of programs easier. A technique that complicates the writing of the program in return for a promised <em>future</em> value will not survive.</p>

<p>Very much worth reading.</p>
