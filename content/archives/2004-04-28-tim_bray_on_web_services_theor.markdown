<p>Not necessarily agreeing with it, still worth linking to: <a href="http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2004/04/26/WSTandP">Tim Bray about Web Services</a>. What I really do like:</p>

<blockquote>[A]pplications that try to abstract away the fact that they&#8217;re exchanging XML messages will suffer for it. Thus, I tend to consider any &#8220;Web Services&#8221; specification that&#8217;s more than two steps away from XML for content and URIs for addressing to be somewhat suspect.</blockquote>

<p>What I assume will create an outcry among Workflow and BPEL people:</p>

<blockquote>And as regards the workflow products, I never once heard of a single successful deployment of a complex automated-workflow scenario on any scale.</blockquote>
