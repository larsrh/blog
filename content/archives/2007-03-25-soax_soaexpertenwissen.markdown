<p>Together with <a href="http://it-and-more.blogspot.com/">Gernot Starke</a>, I&#8217;m proud to be an editor of a new, German book on SOA. It&#8217;s called &#8220;SOA-Expertenwissen&#8221;, and &#8212; if everything goes as planned &#8212; will be available in May. <a href="http://www.amazon.de/SOA-Expertenwissen-Methoden-Konzepte-serviceorientierter-Architekturen/dp/3898644375/ref=sr_1_1/028-9261264-5621310?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1174914132&amp;sr=1-1">Amazon.de</a> has an entry for it already. I&#8217;ll likely do a few posts within the next few weeks and months in German &#8212; this is mainly to let my English-speaking readers know what all those posts with &#8220;SOAX&#8221; in the title are about (Gernot and I are syndicating our blog posts to <a href="https://www.soa-expertenwissen.de/">the book web site</a> this way).</p>

<p>Ah, and here I was thinking that SOAX was a combination of SOAP and sucks. ;)</p>
