<p>Everybody does it, so why not me:</p>

<h1>Grab the nearest book.</h1>

<h1>Open the book to page 23.</h1>

<h1>Find the fifth sentence.</h1>

<h1>Post the text of the sentence in your journal along with these instructions.</h1>

<blockquote>Finally another well-lubricated man in leather underpants performed the same series of movements and ended up standing next to Yevgeny in the same pose: this was a very dark-skinned Negro, not as tall as Yevgeny, but heavier.</blockquote>

<p>The Confusion, Neal Stephenson.</p>
