<p>I&#8217;d love to hear <a href="http://www.gotdotnet.com/team/dbox/default.aspx">Don Box</a> and <a href="http://www.simplegeek.com/">ChrisAn</a> <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/msdntv/episode.aspx?xml=episodes/en/20031218XAMLDB/manifest.xml">sing</a>, but I can&#8217;t, since for some strange reason, the media file is packed inside a Windows .EXE file.
There&#8217;s a perfectly fine Microsoft Media Player for Mac OS X. So why not allow me to use it?
This sucks.</p>
