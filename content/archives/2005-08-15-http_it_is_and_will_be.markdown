<p><a href="http://pluralsight.com/blogs/tewald/archive/2005/08/15/14212.aspx">Tim Ewald</a>, as usual, is absolutely right:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Today, SOAP over HTTP is the only transport that works with two different toolkits at the ends of the wire. Until we have that with other open protocols, HTTP will dominate.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well, almost absolutely (since HTTP is not a transport, as <a href="http://www.markbaker.ca/2002/09/Blog/">Mark Baker</a> would be quick to point out). In any case, using HTTP has so many advantages even if it is mis-used as a mere transport that it&#8217;s hard to see why using something else for heterogeneous integration might be worth the hassle.</p>
