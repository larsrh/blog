<p>I have a hard time understanding Radovan&#8217;s <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/RadovanJanecekNothingImpersonal?m=192">obsession</a> with <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/news/opinion/editorials/2005-11-29-wikipedia-edit_x.htm">Wikipedia errors</a>. Obviously, there&#8217;s going to be lots of unsubstantiated and plainly wrong statements there &#8212; but I have strong doubts the credibility of something like USA Today is any higher &#8230; and if you take a look at the implied suggestions of ISP accountability Seigenthaler seems to wish for, they seem to point into exactly the wrong direction.</p>

<p>I have no obsession with Wikipedia. I&#8217;m using it as example of SOA and Trust. I&#8217;ll write something more about it soon.</p>
