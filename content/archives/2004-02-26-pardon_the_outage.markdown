<p>After some struggle with our ISP, innoQ&#8217;s hosts in the domain innoq.org should now slowly start working again. If you have tried to send me an email, or leave a comment here, and received some strange error message - please try again. If it doesn&#8217;t work immediately, give the global DNS a few hours more to sync our changes.</p>
