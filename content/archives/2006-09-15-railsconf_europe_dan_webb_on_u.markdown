<p>This was an extra session done to popular demand: <a href="http://www.danwebb.net">Dan Webb</a> talked about unobtrusive DOM scripting using JavaScript (which is a well-known approach to JavaScript development that adds behavior to DOM elements based on the classes and ids usually used for CSS). His talk made a lot of sense to me &#8212; he repeatedly advocated for building a working plain HTML/CSS application first and only afterwards add JavaScript and Ajax goodness as optional improvements later. He also talked the <a href="http://www.ujs4rails.com/">UJS Rails plugin</a>, which makes this approach really easy.</p>
