<blockquote>
<p>REST is like Quantum Mechanics; or, more specifically, resources are like atoms (and I do mean atoms, not ATOMs). In quantum mechanics you cannot actually say what an atom is, where it is, or how fast it is moving. You can only predict how it will respond to certain experiments, and then only in a probablistic fashion. As soon as you try to figure out what the wave function actually represents, well then you fall down a sink hole of bad physics and worse philosophy.</p>
