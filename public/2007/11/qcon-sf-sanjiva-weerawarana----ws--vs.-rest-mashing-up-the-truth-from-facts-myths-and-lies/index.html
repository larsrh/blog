	  <p>These are my unedited notes from Sanjiva Weerawarana&#8217;s talk &#8220;WS-* vs. REST: Mashing up the Truth from Facts, Myths and Lies&#8221;.</p>

<ul>
<li>Sanjiva claiming he&#8217;s unbiased, and if he&#8217;s biased, it&#8217;s because I told him to be :-)</li>
<li>to be loved and hated for creating WSDL 1.1</li>
<li>started Apache SOAP, WSIF</li>
<li><p>co-authored lots of other stuff in the WS-* space</p></li>
<li><p>history: why were WS created? people were doing XML over HTTP in 1998/1999</p></li>
<li>everyone invented their own way to do security, reliability, transactions, &#8230; (e.g. RosettaNet, ebXML)</li>
<li>not good from a middleware provider POV, such as IBM</li>
<li>looking for a way to do common things</li>
<li><p>cynical view: RPC between Java and .NET</p></li>
<li><p>WS design rationale:</p></li>
<li>world is not all about HTTP, XML, XML Schema</li>
<li>not all interactions are request/response</li>
<li>composability of features is key (security, reliability, &#8230;, needed, but not al the time) </li>
<li>SOAP 1.1 section 5 created because XSD was not yet a standard</li>
<li><p>Biggest criticism of SOAP in 2000: lack of security</p></li>
<li><p>Question: is the design rationale from 1999 still valid today? Answer: yes, most of them; HTTP not , Relax NG is a lot better than XSD, but bad luck/bad timing; XML is probably no longer questioned</p></li>
<li>Stu: WS were very much centered on XSD. Sanjiva: WSDL is the way it is, including the ability to include COBOL types</li>
<li>WS-* is just overhead unless you have something in your SOAP headers (shows SOAP message without headers)</li>
<li>Lie: always do SOAP</li>
<li>if HTTP(S) + XML is enough for the problem, more power to you</li>
<li>Glen: possible advantage: future extensibbility</li>
<li>Dan Diephouse: most people are doing this because of WSDL, not of SOAP</li>
<li>Lie: you never need SOAP</li>
<li>Sure, let&#8217;s all go back to 1998</li>
<li>REST-* is on its way - ARGH!</li>
<li>HTTP-R, anyone?</li>
<li>no commonly accepted, a.k.a. interoperable REST model for message signing, non-repudiation, reliable messaging</li>
<li>Question: is there an accepted and interoperable standard for WS-RM? A: Yes (with some complaints from the audience)</li>
<li>Question: What is the reference platform? Answer: Microsoft - they led the path, not IBM</li>
<li>Lie: WS-* is complex</li>
<li>reference to Tim Bray&#8217;s slide</li>
<li>reference to our poster</li>
<li>is WS-* really complex?</li>
<li>for the middleware implementor - yes quite</li>
<li>for the app developer: no</li>
<li>WS-* programmers need to understand XML, XML Schema, WSDL and WS-Policy - if they tell you otherwise, find better software</li>
<li>WS tool vendors have not given the right software to developers yet, but are getting closer</li>
<li>Patrick Logan: the last time I tried this, just the basic stuff didn&#8217;t work</li>
<li>Sanjiva: most of the problems come from databinding</li>
<li>Patrick: it was the simple stuff that didn&#8217;t work, that is my definition of complex</li>
<li>Sanjiva: let&#8217;s talk about this and we&#8217;ll sell you some consulting :-)</li>
<li>Stu: complexity is because of differences e.g. in document/lit/wrapped vs. other styles, other example: WS-Attachment problems because of one team mis-understanding the MIME spec. Specs are getting better, but they may be to complex</li>
<li>analogy: is TCP/IP complex: for the stack implementer, yes - for the app developer: no</li>
<li>HTTP has had 15 years to become as solid as it is (myself: exactly! that&#8217;s why we should use it)</li>
<li>is HTTP complex? yes - see Sam Ruby&#8217;s ETech 2005 presentations</li>
<li>Patrick: enormous pressure by the vendors on organizations, but products not ready</li>
<li>Lie: SOAP is about RPC</li>
<li><p>Reality: 0.9 RPC/HTTP only, 1.1. RPC, not HTTP only, 1.2: messaging format with RPC supported</p></li>
<li><p>Lie: REST is easy to learn</p></li>
<li>Large list: if you look at all the standards, including lots of the RFCs</li>
<li>Stu: WS-* includes all of these</li>
<li>Old testament: Roy&#8217;s dissertation    </li>
<li>New testament: RESTFul Web Services book</li>
<li>REST is simple</li>
<li>not true: increasing abstraction, comparison to UML/MOF (MDA was supposed to rule, and now is dead)</li>
<li>Stu: not true,</li>
<li>True REST  is still an art form</li>
<li>Criticising AtomPub took a lot of effort by a lot of really smart people, took 1.5 years - points to Web3S as showing that even they didn&#8217;t get it right</li>
<li>Are you smart enough to build a RESTful application? he claims he is not</li>
<li>are average developers &#38; architects able to design RESTful systems correctly</li>
<li>Question: why is everybody implementing WS-*? Answer: because it&#8217;s the first time everybody agreed</li>
<li>Disagreement from the audience, no it&#8217;s the second time - see HTTP. Again: no, it&#8217;s the third time: TCP/IP</li>
<li>Comment from the audience: Even Flickr couldn&#8217;t work without REST (because of caching)</li>
<li>Hypermedia as the engine of application state not for normal peoples</li>
<li>Microsoft personae: Einsteins, Morts and Elvises</li>
<li>Comment from the audience: it&#8217;s the phrasing, not the content</li>
<li>my claim: if the phrase were &#8220;use documents with links&#8221; it would capture 80% of it</li>
<li><p>Lots of subtleties - method safety, idempotency, caching, uniform</p></li>
<li><p>Lie: REST doesn&#8217;t need a description language</p></li>
<li>Truth: you need to have tooling, thus you need a description language</li>
<li><p>Stu: the real debate is about whether we should have a generic description language or specific MIME types</p></li>
<li><p>Lie: content negotiation, the savior</p></li>
<li>reference to Larry Masinter posting from 2006</li>
<li><p>Comment from the audience: if you write a consumer, the story changes</p></li>
<li><p>Myth: REST programmers eat the payload directly</p></li>
<li>Reality: WS- tools have made programmers lazy</li>
<li>Story of Axis2: they wanted to get rid of data binding, but programers didn&#8217;t accept it</li>
<li>Programmign XML in Java still sucks</li>
<li>RESTfulness won&#8217;t remove programmers&#8217; urge to look for restfulness</li>
<li>other languages have better XML supoprt</li>
<li><p>ES4 will drop E4X?</p></li>
<li><p>Myth: WSDL is widely accepted and used</p></li>
<li><p>Reality: See you at QCon 2015</p></li>
<li><p>Myth: WSDL can&#8217;t describe RESTful services</p></li>
<li>Reality: WSDL 2.0 can describe any RESTful service</li>
<li><p>WSDL 2.0 and WADL are basically the same, inverted in thinking</p></li>
<li><p>Myth: HTTP, the one true protocol</p></li>
<li>Enterprisey: JMS, SMTP, TCP, IIOP, MQSeries</li>
<li><p>Cool: Jabber/XMPP, YahooIM, SIP</p></li>
<li><p>HTTP&#8217;s uniform interface is the greated - untul we need just a tad more</p></li>
<li>WebDAV and DeltaV: a whole bunch more</li>
<li>PATCH: just one more to get it right</li>
<li><p>Stu: There&#8217;s nothing wrong with having an extensible uniform interface</p></li>
<li><p>Myth: REST is multiprotocol</p></li>
<li><p>in reality: was one of those nice in theory, never been done in practice</p></li>
<li><p>true, very true: as long as you don&#8217;t want security</p></li>
<li><p>Discussion with Pete and Dan: no, not true, client </p></li>
<li><p>Myth: SOA was a response to REST</p></li>
<li><p>not true, </p></li>
<li><p>REST is HOT, WS-* is NOT</p></li>
<li><p>REST is at the top of the hype curve, WS-* </p></li>
<li><p>Damned Lie: It&#8217;s easy with REST or WS-*</p></li>
<li><p>Distributed computing is hard, no matter what</p></li>
<li><p>Sanjiva&#8217;s Advice: don&#8217;t get caught up in the hype</p></li>
<li>REST and WS-* both have strengths</li>
<li>best offer both using tooling, similarly to what POJOs did to J2EE</li>
<li>building scalable interoperable systems is still hard</li>
<li>The, on the next slide: Naaah. Just switch to Erlang. :-)</li>
</ul>

<p>I had <em>a lot</em> of disagreements with his statements, but couldn&#8217;t have wished for a better talk in this track.</p>
