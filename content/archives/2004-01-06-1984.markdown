I just have to link to <a href="http://www.apple.com/hardware/ads/1984/">this</a> &mdash; definitely one of the coolest TV ads of all time. Directed by Ridley Scott (director of Alien) and with a cost of US$800,000, it was shown on TV (as an ad) only once, during the 1984 SuperBowl; find out more about its history <a href="http://www.cpinternet.com/cmcalone/cine/1984.html">here</a>.</p>
