<p><a href="http://mult.ifario.us/articles/2006/05/06/more-on-meeting-making-for-google-calendar">Paul Brown</a> explores the <a href="http://rubyforge.org/projects/atom/">Ruby Atom parsing library</a> to work with Google Calendar. I&#8217;m becoming more and more convinced the combination of a dynamic language &#8212; whether it&#8217;s Python, Ruby, Perl or something else &#8212; with REST-based Web services is a killer.</p>
