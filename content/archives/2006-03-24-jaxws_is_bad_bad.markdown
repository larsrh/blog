<p><a href="http://rmh.blogs.com/weblog/2006/03/jaxws_is_bad_ba.html">RMH on JAX-WS</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Doubt what I&#8217;m saying? Try to implement the eBay and Amazon.com web services with JAX-WS 2.0 &#8211; if it&#8217;s really easy than show me and I&#8217;ll eat my words. There you go JAX-WS 2.0 team: A challenge! You guys ought to be ashamed of yourselves. You could have taken this opportunity to re-engineer J2EE web services into something really simple, but you decided to put lipstick on the Pig instead. </p>

<p>Amen.</p>
