<p><a href="http://patricklogan.blogspot.com/2006/06/what-if-unix.html">Patrick Logan</a> asks what would have happened if the first Unix shell had used Lisp instead of a crappy shell language &#8230; interesting thought. Today, there&#8217;s essentially no excuse to not use <a href="http://www.scsh.net/">a decent language for scripting</a>.</p>

<p>(OK, I admit that I don&#8217;t actually use it. But I know I should. It&#8217;s seriously cool.)</p>
