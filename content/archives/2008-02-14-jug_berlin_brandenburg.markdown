<p>I&#8217;ll be giving a talk tonight in Berlin on <a href="http://www.java-berlin.de/2008/02-07/jax-rs-the-java-api-for-restful-web-services/">REST and JAX-RS (JSR 311)</a>. <strike>I will post the slides later</strike> I have uploaded <a href="/blog/st/presentations/2008/2008-02-14-REST--JUG-Berlin.pdf">the slides</a> as well as <a href="/blog/st/presentations/2008/jaxrs-samples-0.6.zip">the sample code</a> (not much news for regular readers).</p>

<p>On a related note, I strongly advise against upgrading all of one&#8217;s example code to a new release of an API two hours before giving a talk about it.</p>
