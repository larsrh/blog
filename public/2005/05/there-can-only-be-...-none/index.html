	  <p><a href="http://www.mcdowall.com/2005/05/service-descriptions-there-does-not.html">John McDowall</a> argues that there is no need to agree on just one service description language.</p>

<p>I believe that it&#8217;s probably best to have none at all <a href="#fn1">[1]</a>.</p>

<p>Interfaces are a great way to introduce boundaries in closed, tightly coupled software systems; depending on the interface enables you to plug in implementations as you need them. But in the Web services world, it&#8217;s an unattainable pipe dream that you will ever be able to design <em>the</em> perfect interface. Designing interfaces correctly requires that you know up front how and &#8212; at least to a certain degree &#8212; by whom your services will be used. Whatever way you choose to decide whether a bunch of operations belong to a single interface, or two, or more, you&#8217;ll end up with a use case later that will demonstrate that you made the wrong decision. </p>

<p><a name="fn1"></a>[1] Of course <a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~fielding/pubs/dissertation/rest_arch_style.htm#sec_5_1_5">a single, uniform one</a> will do as well.</p>
