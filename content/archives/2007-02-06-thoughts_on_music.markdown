<p><a href="http://www.apple.com/hotnews/thoughtsonmusic/">Steve Jobs</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>So if the music companies are selling over 90 percent of their music DRM-free, what benefits do they get from selling the remaining small percentage of their music encumbered with a DRM system? There appear to be none. If anything, the technical expertise and overhead required to create, operate and update a DRM system has limited the number of participants selling DRM protected music. If such requirements were removed, the music industry might experience an influx of new companies willing to invest in innovative new stores and players. This can only be seen as a positive by the music companies.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Someone who works in the content-producing industry wrote this? Unbelievable.</p>

<p>He&#8217;s not really working in the content producing industry, is he?</p>

<p>He&#8217;s rather working in the content selling industry, and as that he certainly has an interest to increase the value of the product for the customers, make it on-par with audio CDs.</p>
