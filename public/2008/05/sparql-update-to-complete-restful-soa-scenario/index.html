<p>The so far certainly RESTful Web of Linking Open Data provides an outstanding real world pattern for RESTful SOA - as long as there is only read access. Imagine enterprises can easily publish their data internally in the same way, and so cross-enterprise organizations could do (assumed that security requirements are as well satisfied). When it comes to UPDATE in Linking Open Data, this most probably will be realized using SPARQL Update. While this is a language not an application protocol, it is based on assumptions on such a protocol, e.g. by addressing the Graph Store and not the Graph. So it might by worthy to "avoid making the same mistakes as Web services".</p>
