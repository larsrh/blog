<p>Note to self: This seems to be a nice way to keep my <a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0107481/stories/2002/11/12/listOfRssSubscriptions.html" title="List of RSS subscriptions">list of RSS subscriptions</a> in sync, which are currently redundantly stored in a local OPML file on my hard disk as well as at blogrolling.com.<br />
It's a nice idea to use the <a href="http://www.w3.org/2001/05/xslt">XSLT service at W3C</a>, and with XP's support for opening files from a URI it should be easy to import the server-side OPML into SharpReader.</p>
