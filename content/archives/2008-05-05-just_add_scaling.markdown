<p><a href="http://ola-bini.blogspot.com/2008/05/just-add-scaling.html">Great post</a> from Ola Bini about the "lack of scalability" of Ruby. It's interesting to see how many commenters totally miss the point, either feeling they need to explain scalability to him, our mixing up a framework (Rails) with a language (Ruby). </p>
