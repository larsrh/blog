<p>It&#8217;s been a few days over a year since I started this blog, so maybe it&#8217;s a good time to reflect on some issues.
First of all, writing a weblog is fun in a strange sort of way, and it&#8217;s also very hard not to do once you have started. Sometimes, my motivation for writing here is to get something off my chest, sometimes it&#8217;s only to have a place to store some references &mdash; often so that I can find them myself later on.
The few occasions where I actually feel that having the blog is really beneficial for me is when I write about something and the writing itself helps me to find out what I really think. It&#8217;s one thing to talk to people about issues, it&#8217;s a totally different one to try to put it into decent writing.
While I still can imagine that I will stop the <em>writing</em> some day in the future (but not anytime soon), it&#8217;s hard to imagine that I will stop the <em>reading</em>. I strongly feel that I&#8217;m learning a lot from the bunch of weblogs I follow, most, if not all of them, much better than my own.
What I find hugely interesting is that I seem to have a bunch of readers I know next to nothing about, apart from the fact that they are using strange browsers or news readers that I can positively rule out being used by anyone I do know.
Two things I plan to do in the future are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Properly categorize existing entries, and use meaningful categories from the start for new postings. The few categories I have right now are not very useful; once I have changed this, I&#8217;ll provide separate RSS feeds for them so that you can take you choice (and filter out e.g. private or fun postings).</li>
<li>Write more original content. This is, of course, a matter of having the time to do so; still, it&#8217;s not really my goal to link to other people&#8217;s work so much (although I&#8217;ll still point to stuff I find interesting).   </li>
</ul>

<p>Please let me know if there&#8217;s anything else you&#8217;d like to see here &#8230;</p>
