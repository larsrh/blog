<p>In the lunch break, I spent some time talking to David Heinemeier Hansson, who seems like an ordinary guy despite being asked for autographs :-) I asked why the Atom Publishing Protocol was not chosen as the communication protocol for the new RESTful model exposure, which led to some discussion about whether or not XML is simply a hash. (I don&#8217;t think it is, and I do think that it must be possible to use namespaces in the XML exchanged between default Rails apps and ActiveResource, but found my powers of persuasion lacking.) We also briefly talked about the <a href="/blog/st/2006/09/14/is_ruby_too_slow.html">Ruby is slow debate</a> &#8212; at the conference like this, though, the opinions on this issue are unsurprisingly unanimous.</p>
