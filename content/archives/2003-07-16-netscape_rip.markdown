<p><a href="http://www.mozillazine.org/talkback.html?article=3422" title="AOL Cuts Remaining Mozilla Hackers">mozillaZine reports:</a><br />
</p><blockquote>It has been learned through public and private sources that AOL has cut or will cut the remaining team working on Mozilla in a mass firing and are dismantling what was left of Netscape (they've even pulled the logos off the buildings). Some will remain working on Mozilla during the transition, and will move to other jobs within AOL</blockquote>

<p>The news isn't all doom and gloom, folks. I've been informed that the number of volunteer Mozilla hackers started eclipsing the number of Netscape hackers last month, and that a number of folks have already been snatched up by other organizations..<br />
Somehow very sad, and somehow not. Sad because on of the companies who were most important to the Web's success is gone now; on the other hand, Mozilla and related projects/product (like FireBird) seem to be alive and well. One good thing that might come of it is that some larger organizations might finally feel the need to dump their Netscape 4.x installations ...</p>
