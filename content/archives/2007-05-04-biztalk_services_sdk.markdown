<blockquote>
<p>The feature set in this SDK is really quite amazing. Using these bits, you can do simple HTTP GET&#8217;s on URI&#8217;s. You can syndicate data using Atom + RSS. You can build&#160;RESTful services that use PUT, DELETE, and other features of HTTP. You can use the Relay service as a broker for doing NAT traversal securely.</p>
