<p><a href="http://lesscode.org/2005/09/24/web-services-infrastructure-kid/">A <em>brilliant</em> posting</a> by Ryan Tomayko</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The next time someone is selling you infrastructure for Web Services, or SOA, or ESB, or whatever they&#8217;ll call it next, make sure you ask &#8220;Why?&#8221; After they tell you, make sure you understand, agree, and have the problems they propose to solve. If not, ask again. New framework and infrastructure is extremely expensive in more ways than one: you have to ramp people on it and then deploy, manage, monitor, and support it. Sometimes new infrastructure is unavoidable but when it overlaps a large portion of your existing infrastructure, you should make sure it&#8217;s bringing back a significant return.</p>
