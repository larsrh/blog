<p><a href="http://www.snellspace.com/wp/?p=788">James Snell</a> shows an example of GData batch updates and writes:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If the mere sight of this doesn&#8217;t give you shivers and shakes, let me give you a few reasons why it should.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Shivering and shaking, I note that in addition to his (very valid) reasons, XML fragments like</p>

<pre><code>&lt;batch:operation type="insert"/&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>should make it obvious: Anytime you find yourself adding words like &#8220;operation&#8221; to your representation, you&#8217;ve violated one of the core RESTful HTTP principles, which is that the intent should be communicated using the HTTP verb.</p>

<p>I hope this helps make it clear why some of us in the Atompub WG argued batch out of the spec. There are other essential problems with batch over HTTP; I&#8217;m not sure it can be done cleanly.</p>

<p>Incidentally, I don&#8217;t see how gdata batch is any worse than the features draft or requests to use Atompub to upload binary+atom in one shot for media resource handling.</p>

<p>Bill, I can understand the reference to compound posts, but I&#8217;m not sure why you&#8217;re drawing a comparison to the features draft.</p>
