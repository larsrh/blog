<p><a href="http://www.windley.com/2004/01/12.html#a985">Phillip Windley</a> has written an article about <a href="http://www.infoworld.com/article/04/01/09/02TCflamenco_1.html">Flamenco&#8217;s Web services management platform</a>. Very interesting; my only caveat from a cursory glance at it is this:</p>

<blockquote>As part of that provisioning, the partner downloads and installs a Flamenco end point customized for that connection. The partner&#8217;s end point intercepts SOAP messages sent on their network and uses a secure, monitored peer-to-peer connection to forward the messages to the provider&#8217;s Flamenco end point.</blockquote>

<p>So how does this fit with the idea of Web services as a <em>standard</em> platform - one that relies on open standards and does not enforce any restrictions on operating systems or hardware platforms?</p>
