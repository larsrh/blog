<p><a href="http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2007/09/21/Rubinius-Sprint">Tim Bray</a> about <a href="http://rubini.us/">Rubinious</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In my view, Ruby isn&#8217;t finished. It&#8217;s a great substrate for Rails, it&#8217;s immensely useful for building all sorts of things, but it&#8217;s not fast enough. I agree with Avi Bryant&#8217;s argument that a language isn&#8217;t finished until it&#8217;s fast enough to extend itself. Frankly, none of the language enhancements proposed for Ruby 2.0 make my heart go pitter-patter. But give me a Ruby with performance as good as a really good Smalltalk VM, and the space of things for which you need statically-typed languages shrinks to a really uninteresting size.</p>
