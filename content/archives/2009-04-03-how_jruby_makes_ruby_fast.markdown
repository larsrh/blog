<p>Superb post by JRuby lead developer <a href="http://blog.headius.com/2009/04/how-jruby-makes-ruby-fast.html">Charles Nutter</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I thought perhaps a discussion about the process of optimizing JRuby might help folks understand what's involved in building a fast, compatible Ruby implementation, so that these periodic shootouts don't get blown out of proportion. Ruby can be fast, certainly even faster than JRuby is today. But getting there while maintaining compatibility is very difficult.</p>
