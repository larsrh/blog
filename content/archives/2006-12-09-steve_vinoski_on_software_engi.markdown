<p>I&#8217;m not a big fan of podcasts, simply because I can consume information about 10 times faster by reading, but if this were different, <a href="http://www.se-radio.net">Software Engineering Radio</a> would be up very high on my list. I listened to <a href="http://www.voelter.de/index/blog.html">Markus Voelter</a> <a href="http://www.se-radio.net/index.php?post_id=151247">interviewing</a> <a href="http://blogs.iona.com/vinoski/">Steve Vinoski</a>, which was really interesting.</p>
