<p>I have commented on this <a href="/blog/st/archives/000271.html">before</a>, so it&#8217;s nice to see <a href="http://www.25hoursaday.com/weblog/CommentView.aspx?guid=a2065106-11b5-4239-824c-5dcc1b525415" title="Dare Obasanjo aka Carnage4Life - Misinformation on XML.com: Microsoft and Binary XML">Dare Obasanjo&#8217;s comments on Microsoft and Binary XML</a>. I strongly believe that this path is not worth pursuing. That is not to say that I don&#8217;t consider <a href="/blog/st/archives/000429.html">Indigo</a>&#8217;s approach to optimizing communication between the same WS(Web Service) stack&#8217;s instances flawed in any way - on the contrary, I think it would be great to have something similar in <a href="http://www.systinet.com/products/overview">other stacks</a>, as well. <em>Standardizing</em> a binary protocol, though, is cleary a step backwards, IMO.</p>
