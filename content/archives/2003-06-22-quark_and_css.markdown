<p>Found via <a href="http://www.stopdesign.com/">stopdesign</a>: <a href="http://www.quark.com/" title="Quark Incorporated">Quark's Website</a> is now completely table-free and CSS-based, and it's looking pretty great. With <a href="/">our own website</a>, we have taken the approach to find something that looks good in every browser we could get our hands on. The result is an absolutely crazy load of nested tables, making every minor change a serious pain in the ass. Perhaps it's time to finally move to a pure CSS design, and bid farewell to all those Netscape 4.x users. Sigh. If only one of our most important customers decided to switch to something more decent ...</p>
