<p>Via the <a href="http://xml.coverpages.org/ni2003-05-29-a.html">XML Cover Pages</a>, I came across this nice, clean <a href="http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-simple-xcap-01.txt">spec</a>:</p>

<blockquote>XCAP allows a client to read, write and modify application configuration data, stored in XML format on a server. XCAP is not a new protocol. XCAP maps XML document sub-trees and element attributes to HTTP URIs, so that these components can be directly accessed by HTTP.</blockquote>
