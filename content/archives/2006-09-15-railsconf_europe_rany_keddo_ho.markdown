<p>Rani Keddo talked about a Rails project that was done at a German bank &#8212; basically, by keeping quiet about it and using white lies and cheating :-) Entertaining talk, I could very easily relate to many things &#8212; e.g. the DB administrator refusing to have any entity other then himself execute SQL scripts, the horror of trying to introduce MySQL in a financial institution, or the indignation of the senior architect at a development completely ignoring all company-wide development standards.</p>
