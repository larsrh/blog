Now, why anybody would think Windows' suspend mode unsafe, I don't know, but how hard is it to think about people who actually use a notebook computer <em>and suspend by closing the fucking lid?</em>

It's really amazing how hot a ThinkPad can get when it's running at full power inside its carrying bag.

<p>No shit man - Media Player is annoying as fuck about that - I often find my Toshiba with a dead battery because windows was so fucking retarded it popped up some stupidass window asking me some conditional before a suspend&#8230; which of course is done by closing the lid&#8230;</p>

<p>I wouldn&#8217;t put my name on code this bad&#8230;</p>
