<p>Wired has a <a href="http://www.wired.com/news/culture/0,1284,58452,00.html" title="Wired News: Wacky Iraqi Minister a Web Star">story about the Iraqi information minister</a>, who is obviously becoming an Internet celebrity. I expect it's just a few months until he will appear in the first TV show ... I just can't make up my mind whether this is funny or not.</p>
