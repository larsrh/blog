<blockquote>
<p>With all the buzz about Halo 3, Microsoft couldn&#8217;t help but to use it as an excuse to make users download SilverLight. It is not really a showcase though, as it does not do anything an experienced designer could not already do with Flash or even straight HTML/JavaScript.<br /><br />It does however demonstrate the same fundamental flaws that Flash did. Specifically, you do not get bookmarks. I would love to provide you a link to the new character images, but the best I can offer is the gateway page.</p>

<p>Microsoft&#8217;s vision of the future of Web UIs doesn&#8217;t support URIs? I bet it&#8217;s going to be a <em>great</em> success.</p>
