<p>Dear John,</p>

<p>I just wanted to let you know that I feel sorry for you - you spent about one and a half hour posting comments to about 20 different entries in this blog, linking to some useless mortgaging site, and it took me about 30 seconds and 2 mouse clicks to get rid of all of them. </p>

<p>I cannot imagine that anyone would pay you for something as useless as this, so I hope you find other ways to feed your kids.</p>

<p>Best,
Stefan</p>
