<p><a href="http://schneider.blogspot.com/2008/05/why-enterprise-architecture-is-joke.html">Jeff Schneider</a> writes (emphasis mine):</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Many EA's [Enterprise Architects] never had a chance. They live in organizations that fund everything according to business silos. Then, the EA is expected to bridge the silos with nickle and dime funding. Their inability to perform Herculean change (multi-channel, master data, cross-organizational BPM, master SOA services) has many of them designated as <em>cops with no gun, just a good flashlight</em>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What a great metaphor.</p>
