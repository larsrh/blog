<p>Last Thursday and Friday were extremely interesting &mdash; <a href="/">we</a> had asked our friends at <a href="http://www.systinet.com">Systinet</a> for an in-depth workshop on <a href="http://www.systinet.com/products/wasp_jserver/overview">WASP</a>&#8217;s advanced features, and <a href="http://www.radovanjanecek.net/blog">Radovan</a> kindly sent us three of the core developers. It was great fun spending two days with Tobbi, Mirek, and Jirka, and once again I was impressed by the level of expertise everybody working for that company seems to have.</p>

<p>Now we&#8217;ll have to put our newly-gained knowledge about writing custom serializers, transports, and the intricacies of WS-Security to work &#8230; this product is really, really cool, and I can&#8217;t wait to get my hands on <a href="http://radovanjanecek.net/blog/archives/000047.html">the other stuff</a> that Rados currently only hints at :-)</p>
