	  <p>While I don&#8217;t agree with his views very much, I really admire <a href="http://kerneltrap.org/node/4484">Richard Stallman&#8217;s consistency</a>. It must surely be great not to be plagued by even the slightest doubt about one&#8217;s own views as RMS is &#8230; it&#8217;a also very interesting to consider his opinion regarding the <em>use</em> of free software and the expectations as to what a company would be expected to give back to the community in the light of the recent discussion between <a href="http://www.adambosworth.net/archives/000038.html">Adam Bosworth</a>, <a href="http://blog.kowalczyk.info/archives/2004/12/29/google-we-take-it-all-give-nothing-back/">Krzysztof Kowalczyk</a>, <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/dareobasanjo/archive/2004/12/30/344469.aspx">Dare Obasanjo</a> and <a href="http://weblogs.cs.cornell.edu/AllThingsDistributed/archives/000533.html">others</a> &#8230; </p>

<blockquote>
<p>A: Back to my earlier question, as a specific example do you use tools such as Google when attempting to locate online content?<br />
Richard Stallman: I have nothing against communicating with Google&#8217;s network server, but for Google&#8217;s sake I hope they have the freedom to study, change and redistribute the software used on their server. Having the freedom to do so does not imply the obligation to do so; Google doesn&#8217;t have to change or redistribute the software they run. But they ought to be free to do this, just as you and I should be free to do this with the software on our machines.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Then again, free software is not the same as open source software, so RMS&#8217;s view is not necessarily universal.</p>
