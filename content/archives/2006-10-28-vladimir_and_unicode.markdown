<p>My colleague Vladimir has <a href="/blog/vd/2006/10/is_ruby_enterpr.html">a long and elaborate post</a> about missing Unicode support in Ruby and RoR. I totally agree that any decent language needs to support Unicode natively, and I can only hope it will not take Ruby too long to get there.</p>

<p>My favorite links on Unicode in general: <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/Unicode.html">The Absolute Minimum Every Software Developer Absolutely, Positively Must Know About Unicode and Character Sets (No Excuses!)</a>, by Joel Spolsky, <a href="http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2003/04/06/Unicode">On the goodness of Unicode</a> and of course <a href="http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2006/10/22/Unicode-and-Ruby">Unicode and Ruby</a> (both by Tim Bray).</p>
