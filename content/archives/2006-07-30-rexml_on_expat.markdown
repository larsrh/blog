<p><a href="http://www.intertwingly.net/blog/2006/07/30/REXML-on-Expat">Sam Ruby</a> shows how to integrate <a href="http://www.germane-software.com/software/rexml/">Ruby&#8217;s REXML API</a> with <a href="http://expat.sourceforge.net/">Expat</a>. Interestingly, REXML is a pull API, while Expat is SAX-based &#8212; a difference Sam addresses via continuations. Very cool.</p>
