	  <p><a href="http://www.docuverse.com/blog/donpark/2003/08/15.html#a814" title="Don Park's Daily Habit">Don Park</a> points to an <a href="http://developer.java.sun.com/developer/technicalArticles/WebServices/fastWS/index.html">article at Sun's java website</a> that describes how a 4-10 times performance improvement was achieved by using a binary protocol instead of XML (using a mapping from XML Schema to ASN.1). </p>
<p>Given that they used the Java Web Services Development Pack, which includes Axis as its SOAP stack, this doesn't impress me much. After all, there are implementations out <a href="http://www.systinet.com">there</a> that run a lot faster than that.</p>
<p>With <a href="http://www.omg.org/technology/documents/spec_catalog.htm" title="Catalog of OMG Specifications">IIOP and CDR</a> (if I remember correctly), if both parties in a communication used the same byte order, the ORB implementation could essentially simply map the bytes from the network interface to memory; using a C struct, you could then address this memory area directly, arguably yielding the best performance theoretically possible.
With languages like Java (or C# or other higher level, VM-based languages), that is no longer possible. After the bytes have been read from the net, they still need to somehow be mapped to the programming languages implementation; the same is true for the response.</p>
<p>Using a binary data representation instead of XML optimizes just one (minor) step in the end-to-end message processing chain, with the downside of losing all human readability. </p>
<p>I don't think this is worth it.</p>

<p>&#8230; unless of course you are developing for a MIDP device with very limited bandwidth and almost no memory or computing power. Then a binary representation can come in very handy. Actually, I believe it is currently a necessity, until mobile devices get more powerful and G3 networks are up, running, and affordable.</p>

<p>Just my 2 cents.</p>

<p>True. Although I&#8217;d question whether XML, in any form - even binary -, makes sense on such devices &#8230;
Then again, I don&#8217;t believe in the usefulness of all that MIDP stuff anyway ;-)</p></p>

<p>Well, you asked for it&#8230; ;-)</p></p>

<p>With WebServices becoming ubiquitous, many people think that one should talk to them (weird, I know) - even from MIDP. My personal opinion is that you should use a proxy and some proprietary lightweight protocol to invoke WebServices from MIDP, but then again, nobody ever listens to me anyway ;-)</p>

<p>But seriously, MIDP is not so bad after all. What&#8217;s missing is phones that implement enough optional libraries, which are not included in the core MIDP support. Also those optional libraries have to finally be finished. JCP is taking forever&#8230;</p>

<p>Two libraries I&#8217;d like to see on phones real soon are:
JSR-82 (Bluetooth) hardly available on any phone
JSR-75 (PDA/PIM-Support) not a spec yet</p>

<p>JSR-75 would finally allow MIDlets to access the native contact database on your cellphone. Something that can&#8217;t be done in pure Java at the moment. And I always thought that would be one of the key applications of MIDP&#8230; but what did they do? They added a game API for MIDP 2.0&#8230; kids rule the world.</p>

<p>On top of this vendors like Nokia still manufacture phones with an artificial 64kb application size limit. Sigh.</p>

<p>BTW, while looking up the JSR numbers, I found JSR-80 (USB). It was accepted as JSR in 9/2000! Wow. Hard to believe that it takes more than three years to come up with a USB API&#8230; Wonder what takes them so long&#8230;</p>

<p>So you fell for the flame bait ;-)</p></p>

<p>Seriously, I have next to zero knowledge and no experience with MIDP, so I&#8217;m not qualified at all to judge this. Purely from an end-user perspective, I now fail to see the value in all those little gadgets - nerdy, fun to play with, but not really that useful.</p>
