<p><a href="http://seanmcgrath.blogspot.com/2005_03_20_seanmcgrath_archive.html#111155882600311020">Sean McGrath</a> points to <a href="http://www.getluky.net/archives/000044.html">Gordon Luk&#8217;s astounding finding</a> that locking/transactions on the Internet is not a good idea.</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t think anyone ever really believed that this would be feasible <em>on the Internet</em>. I don&#8217;t think the folks who came up with <a href="http://www-128.ibm.com/developerworks/library/specification/ws-tx/">the relevant WS-* specs</a> ever did.</p>
