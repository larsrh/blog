	  <p>When I'm on vacation, I read about 3-5 books per week – in fact, sitting in the sun and reading pretty much equates vacation for me. For some reason, I had forgotten <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/12/14/books/14cric.html">this story</a> about Michael Crichton's "Next", which originally made me want to avoid giving the author any money for this shit. Sadly, I wasted the money and bought it, and even more stupidly, I actually read it.</p>

<p>What a crappy book! Totally illogical, with numerous parallel plots that either never connect or do so in a ridiculous manner. I liked a lot of other stuff Crichton wrote, but this one should be avoided.</p>

<p>What are your favorite books so far this year?  I need to begin reading books again for fun.  The programming books get a bit dull.</p>

<p>Yeah, I can second that. Crichton has definitely written better books in the past.</p>
