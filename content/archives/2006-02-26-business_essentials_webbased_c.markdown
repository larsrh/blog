<p>My friend <a href="http://www.schmidetzki.net/WebGatePublisher/schmidetzki/html/default/home">Wolfgang</a> (or, to be more exact, his company, <a href="http://www.innovationgate.com/">Innovation Gate</a>) has launched <a href="http://www.be.innovationgate.com/">Business Essentials</a>, a Web-based, fully Ajax-featured CRM + order management + project tracking solution. It&#8217;s free for up to 3 users, and as I&#8217;ve been able to test-drive it for some time, I can say with some confidence that it <em>totally</em> rocks.</p>

<p>At the moment, it seems to be available in German only, though, although I guess that&#8217;s going to change soon.</p>
