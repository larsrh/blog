<blockquote>
<p>A good book is going to answer a question you didn’t know needed to be asked. It’s tough for a busy programmer to find time to read books from cover to cover and learn the material. But every time you need to look something up, you have a golden opportunity to research the material instead of cheating the answer. Use those opportunities to learn: That knowledge is going to make you a better programmer.</p>

<p>I can attest to this being true: I learn much more about any given topic when I&#8217;m offline, e.g. when traveling, where I&#8217;m forced to find the answer with a book and whatever I happen to have installed on my machine.</p>
