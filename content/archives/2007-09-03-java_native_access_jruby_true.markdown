<p><a href="http://headius.blogspot.com/2007/09/java-native-access-jruby-true-posix.html">Charles Oliver Nutter</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>[T]he idea behind JNA (<a href="http://jna.dev.java.net/">jna.dev.java.net</a>) is to use a foreign function interface library (libffi in this case) to wire up C libraries programmatically. This allows loading a library, inspecting its contents, and providing interfaces for those functions at runtime. They get bound to the appropriate places in the Java interface implementation, and JNA does some magic under the covers to handle converting types around. And so far, it appears to do an outstanding job.</p>
