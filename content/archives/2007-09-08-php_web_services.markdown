<blockquote>
<p>A few weeks ago WSO2 released WSF/PHP, a PHP extension that brings full WS-* functionality to PHP. This means that a PHP script can integrate with any system over Web services at full fidelity, including security and reliability. PHP does not need to be the step-child in the enterprise anymore!<br /></p>

<p>Personally, I don&#8217;t care about PHP at all. But I&#8217;m very much looking forward to the same stuff for Ruby and Python &#8212; yet another step towards acceptance in enterprisey circles &#8230;</p>

<p>If support for the mess that is WS-gobbledigood is what is required for &#8220;enterprisey circles&#8221; then I would stick to squares and REST myself.</p>

<p>Fair enough &#8230; but some of us make their money in those circles despite sharing this opinion. If being able to co-operate with WS-Whatever beyond HelloWorld scenarios is what allows me to introduce Ruby to a company, I&#8217;ll be happy to do so and let the rest follow naturally &#8230;</p>
