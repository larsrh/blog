<p>Radovan Janecek has <a href="http://radovanjanecek.net/blog/archives/364.html">a nice provocative post</a> on &#8220;Anti-SOA&#8221;, featuring this &#8220;slide&#8221;:</p>

<blockquote>
<b>Anti-SOA</b>
<ul>
<li>Enterprise Service Bus</li>
<li>BPEL</li>
<li>Service intermediation</li>
<li>Service Oriented Infrastructure</li>
<li>Some WSM </li>
</ul>

<p>Having discussed this with him many times before, I believe I know pretty well why he feels this way &#8230; </p>

<p>An Enterprise Services Bus (ESB) <em>as advocated by most vendors</em> is SOA&#8217;s archenemy. Intelligent infrastructure, in general, is just what one aims to get away from with SOA &#8212; otherwise, we just get EAI in disguise. I don&#8217;t want to rely on a centralized piece of infrastructure, no matter how federated its deployment may be, simply because once the next merger or acquisition happens, I&#8217;ll have two of them, and then three and so on. I don&#8217;t want to see all messages flow through the same channels &#8212; peer-to-peer communication between service provider and service consumer is not something to avoid, on the contrary &#8212; it&#8217;s exactly what one should aim for. If I want to enable a consumer to interact with a service, it should require nothing more than the service description, possibly augmented with some profile information. An ESB is perfectly fine if it&#8217;s used to support a service implementation (or for service enablement, if you prefer) &#8212; the fact that it&#8217;s used should not matter to the service consumer.</p>

<p>BPEL as supported via a central engine in the center of my enterprise IT, usually embedded in my ESB, is just as bad &#8212; what better way to put intelligence into your infrastructure than putting a programming language into it and create the illusion that programming graphically is somehow not programming? A BPEL engine as a runtime for a different way to implement services is fine, though.</p>

<p>&#8220;Service intermediation&#8221;, the idea of putting something smart between your consumer and your provider, sounds nice, except it falls into the same category &#8212; making your network intelligent instead of your endpoints. Service-oriented infrastructure &#8230; well, if it&#8217;s the same product category (intelligent infrastructure), I agree it&#8217;s anti-SOA. I use the term SOA Infrastructure differently, to refer to the sum of your technical decisions with regards to standards and the technical services you deploy &#8230; &#8220;Some WSM&#8221; falls into the same trap.</p>

<p>Agreed, but in a provocative mood, one might also consider adding &#8220;Registry&#8221; to the &#8220;Anti-SOA&#8221; slide!</p>

<p>Yes, one could &#8212; but Radovan is not likely to do so for obivous reasons :-)</p>

<p>Hi Stefan - any links to Radovan&#8217;s post? I&#8217;m going to forward your post here to some potentially interesting lists, so a link to the source might be useful. 8-)</p>
