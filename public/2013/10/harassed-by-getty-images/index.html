	  <p>Ah, the joys of &ldquo;Intellectual Property&rdquo;. I&rsquo;ve been a long-time fan of the wonderful demotivational posters offered by <a href="http://www.despair.com">despair.com</a>. From time to time, I point people to them, e.g. by tweeting about it. In the past, when there was no Twitter (yes, that time existed), I used this blog to do so &ndash; on one occasion not only using a plain <code>&lt;a&gt;</code>, but an <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> element as well, embedding one of their images on this site (<a href="/blog/st/2006/01/demotivation.html">this</a> is the post minus the image). After all, why not send a little traffic to these fine folks?</p>

<p>But obviously Despair uses stock photos &ndash; a perfect use case if there ever was one &ndash;, and the rights to the particularly cheesy ones apparently belong to Getty images. Now I&rsquo;ve received a letter, first from their internal legal department, and &ndash; after explaining the misunderstanding on their part &ndash; now from their lawyer. In both cases, they insist that we need to license the image to use it.</p>

<p>As I didn&rsquo;t copy the image of the poster, but only link to it, this seems entirely absurd to me &ndash; particularly if Despair properly licensed the image, which I&rsquo;m quite sure of. (If at all, Despair might have more reason, but I can&rsquo;t believe they&rsquo;d be that unreasonable, purely out of their own interest.) But my guess is the legal trolls at Getty believe it won&rsquo;t be worth the hassle to me. They&rsquo;re wrong &ndash; I don&rsquo;t believe they deserve a single cent of my (or the company&rsquo;s) money. If you have any advice, or want to share some of your own experience with these people, please leave a comment.</p>
