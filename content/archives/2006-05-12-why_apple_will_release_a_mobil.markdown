<p>I continue to believe that the best reason to believe that Apple is going to do a mobile phone is that (a) you know Steve Jobs uses a mobile phone; and (b) there&#8217;s not a single existing mobile phone that&#8217;s good enough to make Jobs happy.</p>

<p>If Steve Jobs came up with such a phone, I would  probably buy it. I too use a mobile phone, and there is not a phone that makes <em>me</em> happy. It is pleasing to know that someone else cares in the same way I do that also has the capacity to influence the design and production of products for me.</p>
