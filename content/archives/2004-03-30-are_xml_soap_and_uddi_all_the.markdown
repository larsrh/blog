<p><a href="http://www.manageability.org/blog/stuff/xml-fallacies-revealed">Carlos Perez</a> considers XML&#8217;s fallacies revealed. I totally agree with the XML-sucks-as-a-programming-language mantra. XML Schema has its minor share of problems, to say the least. But with the reference to the <a href="http://java.sun.com/developer/technicalArticles/Interviews/livschitz_qa.html">Victoria Livschitz article</a> (I&#8217;ve <a href="/blog/st/archives/000620.html">linked</a> to it before), I wonder why SOAP (which I consider pretty good) and UDDI (which has its own problems, too, but none of them related to this discussion) enter the mix?</p>

<p>Yes they are same, because they all are based on XML</p>
