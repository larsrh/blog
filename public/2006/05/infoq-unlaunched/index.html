	  <p>I&#8217;m pretty excited to be part of an initiative by Floyd Marinescu of TheServerSide.com fame, a new community site called <a href="http://www.infoq.com/news/InfoQ-Unlaunched">InfoQ</a>. Taken from the <a href="http://www.infoq.com/about.jsp">About page</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>InfoQ.com (Information Queue) is an independent online community focused on change and innovation in enterprise software development, targeted primarily at the technical architect, technical team lead (senior developer), and project manager. InfoQ serves the Java, .NET, Ruby, SOA, and Agile communities with daily news written by domain experts, articles, video interviews, video conference presentations, and mini-books. InfoQ primary mission is to contribute to the evolution of the communities we serve. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Together with <a href="http://www.miko.com/">Miko Matsumura</a>, I will be responsible for the SOA community &#8212; which essentially means that I will post news about SOA-related stuff I consider to be relevant there, reserving this blog for my personal opinions. Contributors for other communities include Scott Ambler, Obie Fernandez, Deborah Hartmann, and David Totzke. </p>

<p>InfoQ (hm, I like that name &#8230; I wonder <a href="/">why</a>?) has many cool features that make it pretty unique &#8212; apart from localization and much fancy Ajax UI sugar, the nicest one is personalization, which enables you to tailor it to your personal needs. This includes a personalized news feed that (hopefully) will contain only what you&#8217;re interested in.  </p>

<p>You can find out more about the &#8220;unlaunch&#8221; (we just simply <em>had</em> to avoid the &#8220;beta&#8221; label) in <a href="http://www.infoq.com/news/InfoQ-Unlaunched">Floyd&#8217;s introductory post</a>. Remember that it&#8217;s still not fully ready &#8212; be kind with the development team (who did a great job), and let them know about any quirks at <a href="mailt:bugs@infoq.com">bugs@infoq.com</a>.</p>

<p>Thanks Mark, of course you&#8217;re right. I&#8217;ve forwarded this to the dev team. In the meantime, the way to get a feed is to click on the feed symbol next to &#8220;Contribute news&#8221;.</p>
