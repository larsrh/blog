I have always been a big fan of Mike Oldfield&#8217;s original <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000000WG4/qid=1094928791/sr=ka-1/ref=pd_ka_1/104-0876115-5491963">Tubular Bells</a>, but one thing that I always found sad is that even with the 25 year anniversary digitally re-mastered CD edition, the sound quality is rather poor (understandable, as the record has been made in 1973). </p>

<p>Only recently I found out about the 2003 edition, where Oldfield re-recorded Tubular Bells using the original instruments wherever possible. Sadly, the CD is not really a CD, <a href="http://www.rcarter.34sp.com/oldfield/tubularbells2003.html">just useless crap</a>; but luckily, there&#8217;s a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0000DD556/">DVD audio edition</a>. Whether you prefer the original or this re-recording is a matter of taste. For me, suffice it to say that I have only listened to it about 27 times since last Thursday.     </p>
