<p>As many pundits and members of the Mac community feared, Apple&#8217;s decision to allow dual booting of Macs into Windows has caused all OS X developers to abandon the platform. Across the board, developers are telling those who find the OS X environment infinitely more appealing: &#8220;Just boot into Windows.&#8221;</p>

<p>On a related note, <a href="http://www.parallels.com">Parallels</a> works like a charm &#8212; I know have XP with WebSphere and RAD 6 running in one VM, Lotus Domino Designer, Admin and Client in another. Next up: Visual Studio in a third one.</p>

<p>I haven&#8217;t run any benchmarks, but it feels fast enough for me. At the moment, it does not run in fullscreen mode &#8212; if VMware&#8217;s behavior under Windows is any indication, Parallels will also run much faster once they have this working.</p>
