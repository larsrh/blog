<p><a href="http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/blogs/dw_blog_comments.jspa?blog=440&amp;entry=109780&amp;ca=drs-bl">Chris Ferris</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>IBM, Microsoft, Oracle, SAP AG have published <a href="http://www-128.ibm.com/developerworks/library/specification/ws-soapbinding/">two new Web services specifications</a>: SOAP 1.1 Binding for MTOM 1.0 and WSDL 1.1 Binding Extension for SOAP 1.2.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>One might wonder why this has not been published through the W3C &#8212; but my guess is that the harmless reason is that doing anything for SOAP 1.1 or WSDL 1.1 is no longer on the official agenda.</p>
