<p>Don't know what to do with the 1 GB of storage in your gmail account? How about <a href="http://richard.jones.name/google-hacks/gmail-filesystem/gmail-filesystem.html">this</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>GmailFS provides a mountable Linux filesystem which uses your Gmail account as its storage medium. GmailFS is a Python application and uses the FUSE userland filesystem infrastructure to help provide the filesystem, and libgmail to communicate with Gmail. GmailFS supports most file operations such as read, write, open, close, stat, symlink, link, unlink, truncate and rename. This means that you can use all your favourite unix command line tools to operate on files stored on Gmail (e.g. cp, ls, mv, rm, ln, grep etc. etc.).</p>

<p>Neither have I; I just found the whole idea funny (I bet even the Google folks didn&#8217;t think of this).</p>

<p>Seriously, though, even as a mail storage, 1GB is ridiculous - my last two years&#8217; emails make up for 2 GB alone.</p>

<p>I thought it was a cool idea. I am not sure what to do with it yet, but I am sure I will think of something.</p>
