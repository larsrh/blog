<p>I was looking forward to this, so I was really pissed when it was announced that Why hadn&#8217;t been seen by anybody, including the organizers, when Jim Weirich&#8217;s talks started. Luckily, he arrived in time for his keynote &#8230; and it was just as expected: very funny, slightly weird, and full of magic. (Naturally, all of the slides were cartoon drawings). Some of the things Why talked about were unusual uses of <code>when</code> in conjunction with the <code>*</code> operator (enabling it to check for inclusion of some value in a list of ranges) and his sandbox stuff, which enables the parallel execution of several apps &#8212; he demoed it using two Rails apps &#8212; without them interfering with each other. This would enable dropping a .tar.gz of some application into your running web server and have it be mounted at a new URL (sort of like deploying a Java webapp into a servlet engine).</p>
