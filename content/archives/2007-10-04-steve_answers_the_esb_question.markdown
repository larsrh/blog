<p>I always liked Steve Vinoski&#8217;s posts when he was still at IONA &#8230; but I like them even better <a href="http://steve.vinoski.net/blog/2007/10/04/the-esb-question/">now he&#8217;s not</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Frankly, if I were an enterprise architect today, and I were genuinely concerned about development costs, agility, and extensibility, I’d be looking to solve everything I possibly could with dynamic languages and REST, and specifically the HTTP variety of REST. I’d avoid ESBs and the typical enterprise middleware frameworks unless I had a problem that really required them (see below). I’d also try to totally avoid SOAP and WS-*.</p>
