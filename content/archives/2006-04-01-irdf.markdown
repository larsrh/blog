<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;Steve was nice enough to give Apple a license to his patented RDF technology &#8211; that&#8217;s &#8216;Reality Distortion Field&#8217; for you newcomers,&#8221; said Apple VP Phil Schiller as he introduced the new iRDF box from Apple at the 30th Anniversary event today. &#8220;But don&#8217;t worry, you won&#8217;t remember a thing about it when you leave here today. You&#8217;ll just feel really exited about it and try your best to buy one before the effect wears off.&#8221;</p>
