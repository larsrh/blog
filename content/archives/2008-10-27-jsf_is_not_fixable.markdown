<blockquote>
<p>Unless there are more changes coming that will magically fix the core without an overhaul, JSF should the follow JAX-RPC into the JSR-graveyard.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I emphatically agree. JSF is, in my opinion, a perfect example of what sucks about Java and its ecosystem.</p>

<p>Where were you to fix it when it was still time?
Why could EJB&#8217;s be fixed and not JSF?
I really don&#8217;t get such non constructive assertions.</p>

<p>Because we still have time to build/adopt better solutions. There was a lot of money invested on EJB to admit that it&#8217;s a piece of crap. And JSF is a piece of crap. I&#8217;ve used JSF for a year before I realize that it&#8217;s broken. I don&#8217;t like JSF current implementations either.</p>

<p>EJB3 is a TOTAL rewrite of EJB.
The only relation between EJB3 and EJB2 is the name. Technically (API and Implementation) it has no relation.
History will repeat itself, JSF3 is going to be a TOTAL rewrite of JSF2.</p>
