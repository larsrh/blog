<p><a href="http://martinfowler.com/bliki">Martin Fowler</a> mentions a paper on <a href="http://www.stickyminds.com/sitewide.asp?ObjectId=3248&amp;Function=DETAILBROWSE&amp;ObjectType=ART">XP considered harmful</a> and a <a href="http://www.williamcaputo.com/archives/000053.html">comment</a> on it from William Caputo. Needless to say, both don&#8217;t agree with its assertions. I still think it&#8217;s worth reading.</p>
