<p>I had the great pleasure of being invited to co-author one of <a href="http://steve.vinoski.net/blog/">Steve Vinoski</a>'s <a href="http://steve.vinoski.net/blog/internet-computing-columns/">Functional Web</a> columns -- a big deal for me, as Steve is sort of a childhood hero for me (well, not really, but his technical writings on all things CORBA hugely inspired me when I started my career). The article's topic is node.js, one of the most fascinating and disruptive approaches to network programming I've seen in quit a while. Checkout <a href="http://innoq.com/files/mic2010060080-novdec10.pdf">the PDF of the article</a>.</p>

<p>Nice introduction, thank you. I have to raise node.js priority in my to-do list. </p>
