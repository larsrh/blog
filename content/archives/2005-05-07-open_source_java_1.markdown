<p>There&#8217;s a new <a href="http://blogs.codehaus.org/people/geir/archives/001074_apache_harmony_j2se_project_at_the_apache_software_foundation.html">Open Source Java</a> effort at Apache &#8212; with the list of supporters, I have no doubt that&#8217;s it&#8217;s going to get past Incubator phase.</p>

<p>I still can&#8217;t help but wondering <em>why</em> exactly the world needs this?</p>

<p>Update: The usual calm and rational analysis is up on <a href="http://jroller.com/page/fate/20050507#death_to_apache">The BileBlog</a> :-)</p>

<p>Update #2: Charles Miller&#8217;s <a href="http://fishbowl.pastiche.org/2005/05/08/finding_discord_in_harmony">slightly more serious take</a> on it.</p>
