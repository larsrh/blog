<blockquote>
<p>[A]s you examine your work from previous talks remember this rule of thumb: if your presentation visuals taken in the aggregate (e.g., your &#8220;PowerPoint deck&#8221;) can be perfectly and completely understood without your narration, then it begs the question: why are you there?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#8217;m more and more convinced that presentations should not have slides with more than maybe a dozen words on them, and preferably less &#8212; obviously they won&#8217;t be very useful for someone taking a look at them afterwards, but <em>that&#8217;s not what they&#8217;re for</em>.</p>

<p>I tend to stick to that rule except for &#8216;code&#8217; slides if I&#8217;m giving a technical talk. And I try and get the code sample down to the smallest chunks I can. To be honest, I&#8217;d rather present with a deck of 3x5s for notes and not bother with the projector, but I accept that some things need the reinforcement.</p>

<p>You&#8217;re of course right about the &#8220;code slides&#8221;. Regarding leaving out the projector completely, another aspect is that having some visual support helps keeping your audience interested &#8212; which may be hard otherwise, depending on how amusing and interesting speaker and topic are :-)</p>
