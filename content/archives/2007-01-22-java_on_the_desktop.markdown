<p><a href="http://mooseyard.com/Jens/2007/01/in-which-i-think-about-java-again-but-only-for-a-moment/">Jens Alfke</a> thinks about Java again, but only for a moment. I tend to agree: If you don&#8217;t care much about looks and need a cheap way to get something running on all major platforms, Java UIs are an option; for a consumer app that needs to look cool, it&#8217;s totally out of the question. <a href="http://www.beatunes.com/">There may be exceptions</a>, but I&#8217;m sure they cause a ridiculous amount of work.</p>

<p>My favorite quote from Jens&#8217;s post:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You need to [be able to] lay out the user interface components visually, by hand, with total control over where they go. Automated LayoutManagers don&#8217;t cut it. A corollary of this is that you can&#8217;t move a UI layout from one platform to another and have the computer make everything fit. Computers don&#8217;t lay out interfaces by themselves any better than they can translate French to English by themselves.</p>
