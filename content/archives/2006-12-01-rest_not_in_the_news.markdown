<p>I agree with <a href="http://www.markbaker.ca/blog/2006/12/01/links-for-2006-12-01/">Mark Baker</a>: <a href="http://searchwebservices.techtarget.com/tip/0,289483,sid26_gci1231889,00.html">This</a> is a very superficial look at the REST vs. SOAP debate. In fact, most of what one needs to write about this <a href="http://www.prescod.net/rest/rest_vs_soap_overview/">has already been written by Paul Prescod</a> a long time ago (I just ran across that paper again yesterday).</p>
