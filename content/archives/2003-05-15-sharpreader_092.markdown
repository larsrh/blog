<p>Moved to <a href="http://www.hutteman.com/weblog/2003/05/14.html#000084" title="SharpReader 0.9.0.2">SharpReader 0.9.0.2</a>, hoping that it fixes the problems I had with uninitialized handles after putting the notebook to hibernation mode and starting it up again. <br />
I tried out several others, e.g. RssBandit, <a href="http://www.google.de/url?sa=U&start=1&q=http://www.yole.ru/projects/syndirella/&e=42">Syndirella</a>, and <a href="http://www.disobey.com/amphetadesk/">AmphetaDesk</a>, but clearly SharpReader still rocks, despite the problems.</p>
