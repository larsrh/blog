<p>Never mind that <a href="/blog/st/2006/02/05/bmw_webspam.html">in this case</a>, I believe that Google was right &#8212; Richard Veryard correctly points out:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Look at BMW&#8217;s position from a service-oriented perspective. BMW&#8217;s promotional and marketing capability is critically dependent on Internet search services provided to BMW&#8217;s customers by Google and its competitors. This is of course true of many companies, large and small. But for most or all of these companies (and I presume this is the case for BMW), there is no formal contract with Google that governs this particular dependency, and no defined service level agreement.</p>
