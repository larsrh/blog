<p><a href="http://savas.parastatidis.name/2004/08/16/744d4fc8-d296-460b-ae9c-64af919c3cc8.aspx">Savas</a> tries to make up his mind about which camp &#8212; REST or the rest :-) &#8212; he belongs to. He takes issue with the influence of using terms such as <em>client</em>, <em>server</em>, <em>consumer</em> and <em>interface</em> when talking about service-oriented architectures &#8230; interesting stuff. I disagree that it&#8217;s always services that exchange messages; I believe that e.g. some UI code that uses a services is more of a consumer than a service of its own. And I also don&#8217;t have any problem with the very abstract term <em>interface</em> (which is a lot better than the ridiculous <em>portType</em> of WSDL 1.1); I believe it makes a lot of sense to distinguish between an abstract service contract, which I would define as interface semantics + policy, and its concrete instantiation at a specific endpoint. </p>

<p>But it&#8217;s fascinating to see the topic of language influencing thought process come up two times in one day, although the other occurrence deals with <a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/001374.html">a somewhat different topic</a> :-)</p>
