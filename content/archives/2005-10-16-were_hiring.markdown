<p>This is just a quick note to point out that my company, <a href="/">innoQ</a>, is currently looking for talented individuals to do SOA, MDD/MDA, and general J2EE &#38; .NET consulting. While we have some projects where being able to speak German fluently is not a prerequisite and fluency in English is sufficient, all of our current customer projects are located in Germany (mostly in the Rhine/Ruhr area) or Switzerland (in or near Zurich) and thus require a valid work permit for those countries. Just drop us <a href="mailto:jobs@innoq.com">an email</a> if you are interested or simply would like to find out more beforehand.</p>

<p>(I thought about including the text in German, as well, but as some knowledge in English is expected anyway, why bother. Feel free to contact us in German, though.)</p>
