<p><a href="http://wanderingbarque.com/nonintersecting/2007/10/05/what-is-soa/">Pete Lacey</a> joins the &#8220;What is SOA&#8221; debate, including a nice kick at Steve Jones&#8217;s shin. <a href="http://service-architecture.blogspot.com/2007/10/great-parody-on-technical-it.html">Steve is quick to reply</a>. I don&#8217;t see the two of them get along anytime soon :-)</p>
