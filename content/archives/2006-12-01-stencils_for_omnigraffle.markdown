<p><a href="http://www.omnigroup.com/applications/omnigraffle/">OmniGraffle</a> is one of the best reasons to get a Mac &#8212; think of Visio, only without the overhead it acquired in the last few releases, and done by designers who really know how to build a beautiful Mac UI. <a href="http://graffletopia.com/">Graffletopia</a> contains a huge selection of stencils (&#8220;shapes&#8221;).</p>
