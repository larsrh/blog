<p>OK, so after receiving my shiny, new PowerBook G4 15&#8221;, I spent about 5 hours setting it up. In this time, I have installed and configured the base OS (Mac OS X 10.3 Panther), NetNewsWire, KungLog, Firebird, Lotus Notes, Microsoft Office, Fink, and Proteus; set up synchronization between the PowerBook and my Siemens S55 via Bluetooth, scp&#8217;d my Notes databases from another machine, imported my BlogLines subscriptions into NNW, read up on some blogs, and had a brief IM conversation in between. </p>

<p>This is simply a great, great environment - I might have to start working again tomorrow ;-)</p>
