<blockquote>
<p>Most of the value in SOAP resides in how headers are used in the SOAP processing model and the SOAP extensibility model. Steering developers away from defining headers is robbing them of that value. Rather than thinking in terms of header and body, I prefer to think of them as header and tail.</p>
