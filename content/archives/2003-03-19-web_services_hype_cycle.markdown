<p>I think this Gartner figure entitled <a href="http://www.fawcette.com/dotnetmag/2002_09/magazine/columns/trends/figure1.asp" title=".Web Services Hype Cycle">Web Services Hype Cycle</a> hits right on the mark. I have the feeling we might be a little further along the curve than originally predicted in 2002, but the form is still the same for every new technology being introduced.</p>
