<blockquote>
<p>[F]or those unfamiliar with <a href="http://abyssoft.com/software/teleport/">teleport</a>, let me explain what&#8217;s happening with teleport first. teleport is a program (teleportd actually) that waits for the mouse to touch a side of the screen and, when it does, connects to another teleport-enabled Mac and sends all mouse input (including 2-axis scroll-wheel input) and all keyboard input (with the exception of media keys) to that machine instead of the parent. Then you touch the opposite side of the remote Mac&#8217;s screen as if you are moving from one monitor back to the main one and the connection drops, putting you back on your home machine. It&#8217;s great for having multiple Macs at the same desk as the newer versions include private-key encryption of your input as well as file drags and clipboard sync.</p>

<p>Wow! I need to try this out ASAP.</p>
