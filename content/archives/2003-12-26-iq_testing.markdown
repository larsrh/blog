<p><a href="http://www.markbaker.ca/2002/09/Blog/">Mark</a> has been taking <a href="http://web.tickle.com/tests/uiq/">The Classic IQ Test</a>, so I did, too. I scored 136 and also was classified as an alleged <em>Visionary Philosopher</em>.
So does this actually mean anything? I have no idea. The only thing I can remember about IQ testing is that there was some number (68?) that sets the lower boundary as the IQ you need to peel a banana.</p>

<p>Well, the test seemed suspiciously easy, and as vowe&#8217;s comment thread suggested, it&#8217;s most likely a scam.
At least I wasn&#8217;t dumb enough to send them money ;-)</p>

<p>Freaky, that&#8217;s exactly the number I got too.  Perhaps we can peel two bananas simultaneously?</p>

<p>LOL - that&#8217;d be impressive, indeed ;-)</p>
