<p><a href="http://www.betaversion.org/~stefano/linotype/news/97/">Stefano Mazzocchi</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>So I wrote <a href="http://simile.mit.edu/gadget/">Gadget</a>, which basically is an XML parser on BerkeleyDB steroids. It fragments the XML and saves the XPath projections of it. Then you can reconstruct the &#8220;skeleton&#8221; of the XML, which is the list of all the XPaths that were ever encountered by the parser.</p>

<p>Works on arbitrarily large XML files; might prove very useful. Also interesting:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><a href="http://simile.mit.edu/referee/">Referee</a> is a command line application that reads your web server logs and automatically finds out what other web pages have to say about your own. Unlike trackbacks, Referee is a completely automated tool: all you need is your server logs and a network connection, Referee will do the rest. And will work not only for blogs, but for any URL of your web site, not matter what program generated it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The ultimate ego-surfing support &#8212; something I&#8217;ll try out for sure.</p>
