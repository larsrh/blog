<p><a href="http://diveintomark.org/archives/2006/06/02/when-the-bough-breaks">Mark Pilgrim</a> switches from Mac to Linux, <a href="http://daringfireball.net/2006/06/and_oranges">John Gruber</a> has a great response, <a href="http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2006/06/15/Switch-From-Mac">Tim Bray</a> announces his intention to switch, too.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m way too happy to have something that actually works great out of the box, and runs all the open source and commercial software I care about, to even consider this. But I absolutely understand and respect Mark and Tim&#8217;s reasoning.</p>
