<blockquote>
<p>A quote, by a CIO, on Web Architecture vs. Client/Server Architecture. This passage (from an out-of-print book) highlights, for me, why there are philosophical divides in this architectural debate to this day. I will also note that this reflects common sense today in certain crowds &#8212; the rise of the stupid network, the end to end argument.</p>

<p>Very interesting quotes from as early as 1995, must remember to reference them.</p>
