	  <p><a href="http://www.pacificspirit.com/blog/">Dave Orchard</a> writes about <a href="http://www.pacificspirit.com/blog/2004/01/12/web_services_or_distributed_objects">the difference between Web services and Distributed Objects</a>. He has a very nice explanation about the problems with XML schema extensibility, something that I found to be an unsatisfactory solution to Web services versioning when I <a href="/blog/st/archives/000277.html">wrote</a> about <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyId=61903B0B-61ED-4ADF-9EAA-19D91568A387&#38;displaylang=en">Doug Purdy&#8217;s movie</a> on MSDN.
Before I learned better, I thought that you could validate an XML document against a schema and it would still validate if there were additional elements that were in different namespaces. Sadly, this doesn&#8217;t seem to be the case. If it were, I believe things would be a lot easier &#8230;</p>
