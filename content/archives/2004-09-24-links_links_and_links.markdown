<p>It&#8217;s crazy that the most interesting discussions in the blogosphere always seem to be happening when I&#8217;m either not in a blogging mood or don&#8217;t have the time; anyway, here&#8217;s a bunch of Web services-related links that are all worth following: Tim Bray and others argue about the number and complexity of the WS-* specs; <a href="http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2004/09/21/WS-Research">Tim&#8217;s post</a> is a good starting point. I agree with <a href="http://www.geoffarnold.com/mt-archives/000228.html">Geoff Arnold</a> about <a href="http://www.25hoursaday.com/weblog/PermaLink.aspx?guid=275bab56-3610-4b85-be58-a824cd67979c">Dare Obasanjo&#8217;s JSR comparison</a>. <a href="http://michaelhanson.blogspot.com/">Michael Hanson&#8217;s weblog</a> seems to be well worth subscribing to, but I can&#8217;t seem to find a feed link. I&#8217;ll have to elaborate a bit more on <a href="http://www.onlamp.com/pub/wlg/5629">this post</a> from Simon St. Laurent later; <a href="http://radovanjanecek.net/blog/archives/000141.html">Radovan</a> very clearly demonstrates that it&#8217;s a pity he doesn&#8217;t have more time for blogging &#8212; great post. Mark, Jim and Savas are having <a href="http://jim.webber.name/2004/09/20/16be8a55-dc6b-4854-a962-8f6b97d66525.aspx">a fascinating discussion</a> about REST uniform APIs vs. the ProcessMessage idea.</p>
