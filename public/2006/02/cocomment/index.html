	  <p><a href="http://www.cocomment.com/">coComment</a> is another of those Web 2.0 startups, addressing a real problem for those who leave comments on other peoples&#8217; blogs: I know that I always lose track of where I&#8217;ve commented, and there may be a lot of comments to my comments that I never even saw. I still wonder, though, how hard it would be to build a simple one-click-Javascript-bookmarklet solution that simply sends a trackback to some private page; my guess would be something like a couple of hours at most &#8230; and I really wonder how a whole company could be based on a concept that is likely going to be as trivial to clone?</p>

<p>But they&#8217;re not yet public, so I&#8217;m just making wild guesses.</p>

<p>Hunh. I just use one of the original Web 2.0 sites: del.icio.us. I bookmark the pages that I&#8217;ve commented on and use a tag of &#8220;comments&#8221;.</p>
