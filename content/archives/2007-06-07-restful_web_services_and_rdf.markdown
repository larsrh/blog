<blockquote>
<p>So RDF, just as REST, is at its base very easy to understand and furthermore the two are complementary. Even though REST is simple, it nevertheless needs a book such as &#8220;<a href="http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/9780596529260/">RESTful web services</a>&#8221; to help make it practical. There are many dispersed standards out there which this books helps bring together. It would have been a great book if it had not missed out the other half of the equation. Luckily this should be easy to fix. And I will do so in the following notes, showing how RDF can help you become even more efficient in establishing your web services. Can it really be even easier? Yes. And furthermore without contradicting what this book says.</p>
