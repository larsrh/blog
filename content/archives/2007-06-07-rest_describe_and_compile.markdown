<blockquote>
<p>Thomas Steiner has released version 0.3 of his REST Describe &#38; Compile tool, which creates a WADL description from existing REST messages, and can then in turn generate code for multiple languages. The new version adds support for generating Java code (in addition to PHP, Ruby, Python and C#). To get a first impression of what REST Describe &#38; Compile does, check out the online version; you can also download the source code, which is written in Java using Google Web Toolkit.<br /> Thomas joined InfoQ for a quick Q&#38;A email session to answer some of the most obvious questions about the approach and tooling.</p>
