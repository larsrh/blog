<blockquote>
<p>Nowadays, all the distributed systems development I do is REST-oriented. I know from significant first-hand experience what both sides of the coin look like, and there&#8217;s no question that REST-oriented systems are easier and less expensive to develop, and far less costly to extend and manage. Like Dare said, anyone who thinks otherwise is either so emotionally or monetarily attached to WS-* that they can&#8217;t be objective, or they don&#8217;t actually write any code or build or maintain any actual systems. It&#8217;s no contest, really.</p>
