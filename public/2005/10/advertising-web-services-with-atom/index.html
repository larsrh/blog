	  <p><a href="http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/blogs/dw_blog.jspa?blog=351">James Snell</a> has written an article describing<a href="http://www-128.ibm.com/developerworks/webservices/library/ws-atomwas/"> how to advertise Web service deployments</a> using <a href="http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-atompub-format-11.txt">Atom</a>. While this may not seem a big deal at first, I strongly believe that Atom&#8217;s importance is going to increase dramatically over the next few months &#8230;</p>

<p>Forgive my impudance, but erm, why?  </p>

<p>I agree that Atom is one of the next big things, but I my timeline doesnt quite agree.  I dont know of any major Atom projects coming up.  </p>

<p>Luv, Rektide (btw your blog&#8217;s formatting routinges are way too smart)</p>

<p>I think it&#8217;s not going to be the big projects, rather the many, many small grassroots-style things that people are doing. REST + Atom strikes me as a great combination to build innovative things that have a chance to be adopted very quickly.</p>

<p>(Why are the formatting routines too smart? Did they cause problems for you?)</p>
