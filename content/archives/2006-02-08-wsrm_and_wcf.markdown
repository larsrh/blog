<p><a href="http://blogs.thinktecture.com/cweyer/archive/2006/02/08/414393.aspx">Christian Weyer</a> about WCF&#8217;s <a href="http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/library/ws-rm/">WS-ReliableMessaging</a> implementation:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The only real problem I currently have with the WS-RM implementation in WCF is that they do not have a durable store for the WS-RM messages. It is all in-memory and AppDomain-based.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I guess that makes it WS-SomewhatReliableMessaging ;-)</p>
