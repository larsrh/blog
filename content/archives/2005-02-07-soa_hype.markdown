<p>Ted Neward <a href="http://www.neward.net/ted/weblog/index.jsp?date=20050203#1107473579970">is worried about SOA and the inevitable hype</a>.</p>

<p>I couldn&#8217;t agree more. It&#8217;s not even the promises of <a href="http://www-inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~maratb/readings/NoSilverBullet.html">silver bullets</a> that I&#8217;m worried about, it&#8217;s more that I&#8217;m getting sick and tired of having people label anything even remotely resembling an enterprise architecture of any kind &#8220;SOA&#8221;. The next time I hear someone claiming &#8220;We&#8217;ve been doing SOA for 10 years&#8221;, I&#8217;ll start screaming and howling while rolling around on the floor (which will not be a pretty sight, trust me). And explanations such as the one Ted linked to (I won&#8217;t) do not help. </p>

<p>Of course you can label anything SOA since there is no accepted definition of the term. That doesn&#8217;t mean you should, though.</p>
