<p><a href="http://plasmasturm.org/">Aristotle Pagaltzis</a> in the <a href="http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/rest-discuss/message/11264">rest-discuss mailing list</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In REST, when you
need to provide semantics that arenâ€™t directly available at the
protocol level, your first instinct should be to expose another
resource; and the way to make that all work together is to a)
provide links to clients, that b) have annotations saying what
semantics the client can expect that resource to expose. [...] By staying within
the confines of the uniform interface and hypermedia, you can
contain the spread of that special knowledge to a minimal amount
of code, and you maximise the amount of accidental usefulness
that clients without knowledge of your protocol can still get
out of the service.</p>
