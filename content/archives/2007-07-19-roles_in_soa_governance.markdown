<blockquote>
<p>This article explores a potential set of roles for successful SOA Governance, the roles of &#8220;SOA Domain Architect&#8221;, &#8220;SOA Platform Architect&#8221;, &#8220;Service Designer&#8221;, &#8220;Business Service Owner&#8221;, and &#8220;Technical Service Owner&#8221;. Whether you adopt these names or choose a terminology more in line with your current approach is secondary, but I believe that the tasks described for these roles throughout the following sections need to be formally assigned in any case to ensure SOA can deliver what it promises.</p>
