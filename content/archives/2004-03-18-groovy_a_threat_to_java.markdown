<p>I hope that the JCP executive committee will accept it &mdash; in my opinion, Groovy would be simply a great addition to the JVM platform. Having a powerful dynamic language with access to all of the platform libs, sanctioned by a (semi-)official standard, would propel the concepts from Ruby, {P|J}ython and LISP to the mainstream, something that would really be great for the industry.</p>
