<p><a href="http://www-106.ibm.com/developerworks/library/ws-soaintro.html">An SOA article by IBM&#8217;s Mark Colan</a> &mdash; nothing exactly new, but a great introduction:</p>

<blockquote>In 221B.C., Emperor Qin unified several formerly warring states into a new country, which we now call China. Perhaps one reason China has endured as a nation was Qin&#8217;s introduction of standards, which consolidated cultures and facilitated trade: a standard distance for wheels on carts which allowed them to travel efficiently on any road, a common written language that everybody could use to exchange messages (even if they did not speak the same language), and a strong defense against outside attacks (like the Great Wall of China). You could say that he developed the models for standardized transport, message exchange, and the firewall.</blockquote>
