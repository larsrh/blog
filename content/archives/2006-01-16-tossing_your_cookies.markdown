<p>I&#8217;ve linked to the fabulous <a href="http://thedailywtf.com/">Daily WTF</a> several times in the past, I just thought that this time I&#8217;d mention that everything would be half as funny without Alex Papadimoulis&#8217;s introductions great intros:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>As you read this short introduction, I&#8217;m guessing that you can see today&#8217;s code in your peripheral vision and are wondering, Tossing Your Cookies? What does that have to do with a huge, ugly SQL statement? I&#8217;ll let the combination of &#8220;Cookies&#8221; and &#8220;SQL&#8221; sink in for a moment &#8230;&#8230;.. ahh, there it is. And yes, it&#8217;s <em>exactly</em> what your thinking.</p>
