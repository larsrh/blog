<p>From the <a href="http://blog.phusion.nl/2009/04/16/phusions-one-year-anniversary-gift-phusion-passenger-220/">Phusion Corporate Blog</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>After spending weeks on further development and intensive testing, weâ€™ve now come to the point wherein we have the distinct honor to announce Phusion Passenger for Nginx as an addition to the Phusion Passenger server line-up.</p>
