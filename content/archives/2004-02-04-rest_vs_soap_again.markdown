<p>In a very <a href="http://www.markbaker.ca/2002/09/Blog//2004/02/03#2004-02-ws-stages">interesting posting</a>, Mark Baker points to <a href="http://discuss.develop.com/archives/wa.exe?A2=ind0003&#38;L=soap&#38;T=0&#38;O=D&#38;P=35306">an age-old thread</a> (four years old, to be exact) that I find utterly fascinating.</p>
