<p>The folks from <a href="http://www.jot.com/">JotSpot</a> demoed their application to Jon Udell in a WebEx session, and he has put <a href="http://weblog.infoworld.com/udell/gems/jot2.swf">the demo</a> online. This is really cool - not only do I like the software idea (sort of like a crossover of Wiki and Lotus Notes with some RSS and Web services thrown in for good measure), but also the presentation: this is is a great way to find out what a piece of software does &#8212; someone demoing it, with someone else asking questions that very often resemble what I would have asked myself.</p>

This is far away from Lotus Notes in my opinion.
However: yes, they implemented some realy nice ideas to improve intranets.</p>
