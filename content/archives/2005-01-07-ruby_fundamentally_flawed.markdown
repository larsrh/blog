<p><a href="http://creativekarma.com/more.php?id=260_0_1_0_M">This</a> is interesting because it&#8217;s the first time I&#8217;ve actually seen somebody criticize <a href="http://www.ruby-lang.org">Ruby</a> instead of praising it.</p>

<p>In fact, it was that lack of honest criticism that finally goaded me to put my thoughts into words.</p>

<p>It looks like I&#8217;m not alone any more. Bruce Eckel has just posted an article &#8220;Thinking in Ruby &#8230; not&#8221; (http://onthethought.blogspot.com/2005/01/thinking-in-ruby-not.html) from which I gather he feels the same way that I do: that Ruby&#8217;s an improvement over Perl, but not enough of an improvement.</p>

<p>Thanks for pointing this out. I don&#8217;t know why, but somehow the link is broken:
<a href="http://onthethought.blogspot.com/2005/01/thinking-in-ruby-not.html" rel="nofollow" /><a href="http://onthethought.blogspot.com/2005/01/thinking-in-ruby-not.html" rel="nofollow">http://onthethought.blogspot.com/2005/01/thinking-in-ruby-not.html</a>
In any case, I found your critique to be more informed (Bruce simply seems not to know the language at all.)</p>
