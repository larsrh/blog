<blockquote>
<p>
I see a little silhouetto of a man, Scaramouche, Scaramouche, will you do the fandango<br />
Thunderbolt and lightning, very very frightening me<br />
Authorizer (authorizer), authorizer (authorizer)<br />
Authorizer LID &#8211; O-pen I-D<br />
I&#8217;m just a token nobody knows me<br />
He&#8217;s just a token from a weak authority<br />
Spare him his life from anonymity<br />
</p>
