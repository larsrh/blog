<p>This is possibly going to get linked to death, but Diego Doval has written <a href="http://www.dynamicobjects.com/d2r/archives/002399.html" title="d2r: an introduction to weblogs">an excellent introduction to weblogs</a>. A good thing to point people who ask "A weblog? What's a weblog?" to.<br />
<strong>Update</strong>: Here is <a href="http://www.dynamicobjects.com/d2r/archives/002400.html">Part 2</a>, which explains syndication.</p>
