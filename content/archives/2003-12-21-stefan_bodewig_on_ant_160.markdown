<p><a href="http://stefanbodewig.blogger.de/">Stefan Bodewig</a> has a nice <a href="http://stefanbodewig.blogger.de/">summary</a> of the most important changes in <a href="http://ant.apache.org/bindownload.cgi">Ant 1.6.0</a> (he should know, since he probably is responsible for most of them). I&#8217;m not especially keen on trying out every single new version of tools that essentially just work for me, but the possibility to recursively run a common target through a build file hierarchy sounds very interesting.</p>
