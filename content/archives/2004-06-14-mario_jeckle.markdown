<p><a href="http://www.jeckle.de/">Prof. Mario Jeckle</a>, a very well-known German IT expert and DaimlerChrysler's OMG and W3C representative, <a href="http://www.heise.de/newsticker/meldung/48227">has died in an accident</a>. Although I met him in person only a couple of weeks ago, I have known his name and appreciated his work for years. This is truly a great loss.</p>

<p>He was 30 years old, and apparently died while trying to help some people involved in an accident.</p>

<p>Oh my, what a horrible, horrible loss.  Mario was always as polite and considerate as could be in the few dealings I had with him while we were members of the XML Protocol WG together.</p>
