<p><a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/001034.html">Great links from Jeff Atwood</a>, including a contribution of Knuth&#8217;s to Mad Magazine. My favorite story is this one about <a href="http://folklore.org/StoryView.py?story=Close_Encounters_of_the_Steve_Kind.txt">a meeting of Donald Knuth and Steve Jobs</a>.</p>
