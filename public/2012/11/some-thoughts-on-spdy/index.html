	  <p>What follows is a number of claims about SPDY, none of which I can
back up in any reasonable way. My hope is that readers who know more
will educate me. <a href='http://www.chromium.org/spdy'>SPDY</a>, in case you don&rsquo;t know it, is a replacement for
the HTTP wire protocol. It originated with Google and aims to preserve
HTTP&rsquo;s application semantics while improving its efficiency and
performance.</p>

<ul>
<li>Supporting true multiplexing on top of a single TCP connection is
great. There is no way anybody can prefer the HTTP 1.0 model, which
forces a separate TCP connection per request, nor the HTTP 1.1
model, which allows for persistent connections but still requires
serialized request/response interactions (never mind HTTP pipelining
as it doesn&rsquo;t work in practice). Browsers having to open separate
connections to the same server to achieve parallelism is not a
satisfactory solution.</li>
<li>Reducing header overhead is also an excellent idea. I&rsquo;ve heard some
criticism about the way this is actually done in SPDY, but it very
clearly serves no purpose to have a browser send e.g. the same
ridiculously long user agent string with each and every request.</li>
<li>I used to not care much for the push support, i.e. the
opportunity for the server to actively send stuff to the client, for
the same reason I&rsquo;m not a fan of Websockets: I don&rsquo;t think you
actually need this in practice on the application level. But in a
session done by Jetty developer <a href='http://webtide.intalio.com/author/tbecker/'>Thomas Becker</a> today, I learned about
a quite intriguing usage of this in Jetty&rsquo;s SPDY implementation: On
the first request of a page and the subsequent request for the
resources that are referenced in that page, Jetty will build a map
based on the Referer header &ndash; it essentially remembers which
secondary resources a page references. When the next request comes
along, it can actively send the referenced resources <em>before the
client actually asks for them</em>.</li>
<li>I think the fact that SPDY requires TLS is a mistake. While I
totally concede that most traffic on the Net is (and should be)
encrypted, there are many use cases e.g. within an organization or
for public information where this does not make sense. Besides, it
prevents the usage of intermediaries, even though I admit these will
be much harder to build for SPDY than for plain HTTP anyway.</li>
<li>While SPDY proponents point to impressive performance improvements,
they are the more impressive the worse the website is
implemented. For sites that are already optimized in terms of front
end performance, e.g. minimize and compress content, minimize the
number of requests, usage proper caching, the effect is going to be
much less. That said, some of the things we do in terms of
optimization, e.g. combining multiple CSS or JS files into a single
one, are not exactly milestones of architectural purity.</li>
<li>For machine-to-machine communication &ndash; i.e. typical RESTful web
services &ndash; I don&rsquo;t think SPDY will have the same kind of effect as
for Web sites, but I&rsquo;m willing to let myself be convinced otherwise.</li>
<li>One of the sad but inevitable things when introducing a binary
protocol as opposed to a text-based one is reduced transparency for
humans. If SPDY becomes successful &ndash; and I have small doubts it
will &ndash; being able to telnet to a servers port 80 is going to be
what I miss most.</li>
</ul>

<p>SPDY has a very good chance of essentially becoming the new HTTP 2.0, and I&rsquo;m
happy about it: I&rsquo;m pretty confident the <a href='http://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/httpbis/charter/'>HTTP WG</a> with the formidable
<a href='http://www.mnot.net/'>Mark Nottingham</a> taking care of
things will produce something that will be usable for a long time to come.</p>
