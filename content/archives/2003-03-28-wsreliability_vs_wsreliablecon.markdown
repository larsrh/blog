<p>Apart from some thoughts regarding loose coupling, <a href="http://www.davidchappell.com/HTML_email/Opinari_No5_3_03.html" title="David Chappell :: Opinari">David Chappell </a> talks a bit about the need for reliable messaging over SOAP. I think he has a pretty strange view in one respect: He makes it sound as if it was Sun's and the other WS-Reliability authors' mistake that we now have two specs. In my view, it's just plain stupid that IBM and MS did not just express their problems with WS-Reliability and jointly turn it into a decent spec. But maybe I'm just dreaming ...</p>
