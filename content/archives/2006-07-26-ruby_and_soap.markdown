<blockquote>
<p>For my work, I like the fact that the <a href="http://dev.ctor.org/soap4r">soap4r</a> package is readily available for Ruby. but I have to admit that the design of soap4r strikes me as odd. Given my middleware background, I&#8217;m used to generating C/C++/Java stubs/skeletons/proxies from description languages and compiling them into applications. But Ruby is dynamic, so I don&#8217;t understand the need for a tool like wsdl2ruby for generating Ruby code from WSDL. So I just avoid that part. Instead, I use some of the underlying soap4r classes to do everything I need dynamically.</p>

<p>I agree; IMO, <a href="http://www.onlamp.com/pub/a/onlamp/2004/08/12/ruby_e4x.html">Jack Herrington&#8217;s approach to XML and Ruby</a> would be ideal.</p>
