<p><br />
In an <a href="http://devresource.hp.com/drc/technical_white_papers/WSOrch/WSOrchestration.pdf">HP whitepaper</a>, different approaches to Web services orchestration are described. I'm not really sure what to think about this. The question that  puzzles me most is this: Do we really need standards like this? Is the combination of Web services really something that should be done any differently than the development of a new service or the wrapping of an existing system?</p>

<p>Phrased differently: Isn't it much more efficient to use some sort of scripting language to tie together several Web services to build a larger one?</p>
