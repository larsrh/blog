<p>An older post from <a href="http://jroller.com/page/obie?entry=semantic_enterprise_architecture">Obie Fernandez</a>:</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Interesting; Obie suggests using RDF/OWL for {resources|web services|system components} metadata. See also the comments from <a href="http://dannyayers.com/2006/12/30/qotd--semantic-enterprise">Danny Ayers</a>.</p>
