<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;Designed&#8221; e-mail is just a slightly more polished version of those messages your uncle sends you. Your uncle thinks 18pt bright red Comic Sans looks great, so he sends e-mail messages formatted that way. You cluck your tongue, or sigh, or run de-formatting scripts on every message you receive from him. When your uncle is the &#8220;designer,&#8221; you &#8220;get&#8221; why styled mail sucks. It sucks just as much when you design it, even if it looks better than your uncle&#8217;s work in the two e-mail programs that support it correctly.</p>
