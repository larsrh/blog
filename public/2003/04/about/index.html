My name is Stefan Tilkov, I am a managing director of a Germany- and Switzerland-based consulting company called <a href="/">innoQ</a>. Although I do quite a bit of administrative stuff, I still try to maintain some technical knowledge. This means, for example, that I still consult in customer projects. Fortunately, the company is still small enough so that this is feasible. My technical interests include large-scale software development, preferably using modern, object-oriented and/or component based techniques, and specifically two subareas - Web services and Model Driven Architecture (MDA).
<a href="/">innoQ</a> is a <a href="http://www.systinet.com">Systinet</a> Solution Partner, and I am also
a member of <a href="http://www.systinet.com/news/latest_news/article&amp;id_ele=49">Systinet's Technical Advisory Board</a>. MDA is of interest to me
not the least because innoQ develops and markets a product call <a href="/iqgen/home.html">iQgen</a>, an MDA-compliant (whatever that means) code generator. I run this blog mainly as an experiment, you can find out more about that <a href="">here</a>.
