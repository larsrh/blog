<p>Fortunately, I found an explanation for <a href="/blog/st/2004/10/12/a_new_toy.html">my new iMac&#8217;s noise level</a>: I was using the fast user switching support to enable different environments for my wife and I, for some reason her Safari process had gone up to using 100% CPU, and this was not reported in my activity viewer because by default it only shows the current user&#8217;s processes.</p>

<p>So: If the box really has a lot to do, the fans kick in and they <em>are</em> pretty loud. Running at normal load, it&#8217;s still louder than the Cube, but you&#8217;ve got to have a really quiet environment to notice it.</p>
