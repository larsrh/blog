<p>I&#8217;m just not clear on why a simple URL isn&#8217;t good enough. Why do we need to invent new RPC-style request/response pairs?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The reason is simple: It&#8217;s because of a conscious decision <em>not</em> to depend on HTTP. And I&#8217;m becoming more and more convinced that this is the wrong path. The more I read and think about it, the more convinced I become that ignoring what HTTP and REST offer leads to re-inventing the same functionality on another layer.</p>

<p>Using HTTP and REST is some research I am working on with Dr. Windley. We are trying to see if we can use WS-* standards with HTTP instead of a new layer. It is still in the early research stages but you can see some of the stuff by going to <a href="http://www.dan-olsen.org/research/index.php/Web_Services" rel="nofollow" /><a href="http://www.dan-olsen.org/research/index.php/Web_Services" rel="nofollow">http://www.dan-olsen.org/research/index.php/Web_Services</a> and any input from individuals would be appreciated as the project progresses.</p>
