<p><a href="http://quicksilver.blacktree.com/">Quicksilver</a> is an insanely great Mac OS X utility that you will only be able to appreciate if you&#8217;ve tried it out yourself (or seen someone else demo it, if you are unlucky enough to use an inferior operating system). <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/43Folders?m=484">This</a> is a feature I was unaware of:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>For those of you who haven&#8217;t seen The Light, you can now (again) select virtually any kind of thing on your Mac &#8212; including text strings, URLs, Finder selections and so on &#8212; and &#8220;send&#8221; it to Quicksilver by hitting &#8220;CMD-Escape&#8220;. On the face of it, this sounds like a fairly modest functional addition, but, dang, is it ever powerful in practice. It&#8217;s the primary and easiest way to pass virtually anything into Quicksilver, from where you can then do &#8212; well &#8212; practically anything, as we&#8217;ve seen.</p>
