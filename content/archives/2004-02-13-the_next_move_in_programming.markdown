<p>On java.sun.com, there is a very interesting <a href="http://java.sun.com/developer/technicalArticles/Interviews/livschitz_qa.html">interview with Victoria Livschitz</a>, a senior IT architect at Sun (and also a former chess master and the daughter of a famous mathematician).
There are some minor issues I have with her wording - there seems to be some confusion between functional and procedural languages, and I also believe that thing you use in XML all over is called pointy brackets, not square ones. But her thoughts on the inadequate abstractions we have in today&#8217;s programming languages are very interesting, indeed. Maybe there is a spectrum &mdash;  a language with pure mathematical elegance, like Lisp, for usage by the A-level geeks, and some sort of building block-based, high level programming language for the masses; quite possibly with one built upon the other.
