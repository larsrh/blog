<p>Girls love Rebels. Steve Jobs could have so many many many more chicks than Bill. This is our version of Our God Can Kick Your God&#8217;s Ass. Side note: Apple launches the iTMS with Bono and U2. Bill launches &#8220;Urge&#8221; with post-Janet post-Britney Justin Timberlake. JT may get nominated for Grammies, but Bono gets nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize.</p>
