<p><a href="http://www.intertwingly.net/blog/2006/02/20/Mr-Safe">Sam Ruby</a> with a great entry about Atom vs. RSS. I&#8217;m by no means an expert, but out of a weird interest in this real-world soap opera, I have followed the RSS/funky-RSS/Pie/Echo/Atom developments as an outside observer for the entire time. Based on this, my advice is: If you are considering using RSS, don&#8217;t; use Atom instead.</p>

<p>Maybe the Atom folks should just have called their format RSS 3.0 &#8230;</p>

<p>The RSS 2.0 spec dictates that any derivatives of the spec should not be named &#8220;RSS&#8221;.</p>

<p>I know &#8212; but that didn&#8217;t stop the RSS 3.0 weirdo. AFAIK, Dave Winer tried, but never actually did trademark the acronym. And he&#8217;s pissed off anyway &#8230;</p>
