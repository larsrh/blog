	  <p>In passing, <a href="http://www.25hoursaday.com/weblog/2007/10/06/ThoughtsOnAmazonsInternalStorageSystemDynamo.aspx">Dare Obasanjo</a> makes a very good point (talking about the inapplicability of RDBMS systems to solve very-large-scale requirements):</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Luckily, there are only a handful of companies and Web services in the world that need to operate at that scale.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>While I believe &#8220;a handful&#8221; is a little too restrictive, I&#8217;m pretty sure that for the vast majority of applications, an RDBMS is the right choice (if simple file-based store isn&#8217;t sufficient).</p>

<p>I think a number of these ideas also apply to maintainability, in particular the ability to evolve components more independently than tends to be the case in the IT data centers I am familiar with (and which seem to be the norm, from comparing notes).</p>

<p>Agreed &#8212; my point is probably more organizational, or even political, then technical; reasons for choosing something other than an RDBMS would have to be <em>extremely</em> good.</p>
