<p>I find this interesting since based on conversations on the <a href="http://www.imc.org/atom-protocol/mail-archive/maillist.html">atom-protocol</a> list, it is clear that Google is very interested in the Atom API. Perhaps they have already built this Atom store that Adam is arguing for and will expose the Atom API as a way to interact with it. Perhaps this Atom store accessible via Atom feeds and the Atom API is <a href="http://base.google.com/">Google Base</a>? Speculation is fun.</p>

<p>My guess is that it&#8217;s a safe bet.</p>
