<p>I have changed the method for constructing weblog entry URIs, following this <a href="http://www.quietconfusion.com/2003/02/artificially_intelligent_ia/">nice and detailed description by Jim Ray</a>, to appear more meaningful. For example, what used to be</p>

<pre><code>/blog/st/archives/000841.html</code></pre>

<p>is now </p>

<pre><code>/blog/st/2004/04/the_hidden_impact_of_wsaddressing_on_soap.html</code></pre>

<p>The old pages with the silly, number-based naming scheme are still there, but redirect to their successors automatically.</p>
