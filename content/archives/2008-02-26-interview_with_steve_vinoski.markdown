<blockquote>
<p>In a new InfoQ interview, recorded at QCon San Francisco 2007, CORBA Guru Steve Vinoski talks to Stefan Tilkov about his opinion of REST (very high), occasions when he would still use CORBA (very seldomly) and the role of description languages for distributed systems (negligible). Other topics covered include the benefits of knowing many programming languages and the usefulness of of Erlang to build distributed systems.</p>

<p>We recorded this at QCon San Francisco &#8212; it was great meeting Steve in person. I&#8217;m only kidding a little when I say he&#8217;s one of my childhood heros &#8230; (he&#8217;s not that old and I&#8217;m not than young).</p>
