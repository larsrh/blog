<p><a href="http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2003/mar/19gore.html" title="Former Vice President Al Gore Joins Apple's Board of Directors">Former Vice President Al Gore Joins Apple's Board of Directors</a> - a very cool career change. If he had only become President instead of G.W.B., the world's situation might be very different now - and the current president could be a Microsoft board member ... just a dream.</p>
