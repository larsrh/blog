<p>From the <a href="http://www.jroller.com/page/fate/20031023#death_to_guis" title="The BileBlog"> BileBlog</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
While working with a mouse and ineffectually faffing about with options and pictures to accomplish stuff is enjoyable and satisfying to effeminate developers, the manly developers are more likely to feel rage at being made to jump through hoops and treated like an invalid 3 year old.

<p>How very true ... something Hani does not mention: Not only are GUIs often not very efficient for editing configuration information, I also believe it's critical that anything that can be done via a UI also must be doable via an API, or at least a command line interface.</p>
