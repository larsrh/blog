<p>If you like that, you&#8217;ll probably like Pulp Fiction re-enacted by bunnies in 30 seconds: <a href="http://www.angryalien.com/0605/pulpfictionbuns.asp" rel="nofollow" /><a href="http://www.angryalien.com/0605/pulpfictionbuns.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.angryalien.com/0605/pulpfictionbuns.asp</a> (if you don&#8217;t already know it).
They treated several other great movies that way. I really love their version of The Rocky Horror Picture Show.</p>
