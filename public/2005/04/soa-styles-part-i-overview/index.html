	  <p>When people talk about Web services and Service-oriented Architecture (SOA), it&#8217;s usually a good idea
to ask them what exactly they mean by those terms. There&#8217;s not only a
multitude of standards in this space, but also not one, but at least
three different architectures competing for dominance, each with their
own history, strengths, and weaknesses; those who favor one of them
usually have little to no tolerance for others who believe in another
one.</p>

<p>I will try to describe what I perceive to be the three most important
styles of doing SOA. In this context, my intent is to use the term
&#8220;SOA&#8221; as something that subsumes all of the Web-based distributed
computing styles currently en vogue; some use SOA to describe Web
services. I take the liberty to declare what SOA means simply because
any definition is as good as this one, and I need some sort of
umbrella term. (And yes, that means I actually consider REST to be
one way of doing SOA.) </p>

<h3>RPC-style Web services</h3>

<p>First, there is the RPC (Remote Procedure Call) style. This style is
rooted in distributed object technologies such as <a href="http://www.corba.org/">CORBA</a>, <a href="http://www.webopedia.com/TERM/D/DCOM.html">DCOM</a>, or <a href="http://java.sun.com/products/jdk/rmi/">RMI</a>;
essentially, it takes the same development model, exchanges <a href="http://www.omg.org/gettingstarted/omg_idl.htm">IDL</a> for
<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/wsdl">WSDL</a> and <a href="http://www.w3.org/XML/Schema">XML Schema</a>, replaces the data format used to encode messages on the wire
with XML (more specifically: <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/soap/">SOAP</a>), and uses <a href="ftp://ftp.isi.edu/in-notes/rfc2616.txt">HTTP</a> as a transport
protocol. The fact that HTTP, XML and SOAP are used is nothing more
than an implementation detail. If this style is combined with
so-called contract-first design, the WSDL becomes visible; in many
cases, though, it is generated behind the scenes from some programming
language construct (usually an interface or class). The most important
construct in this style is the <em>interface</em>. Accepting some rather heavy
oversimplification, it would be fair to call this style &#8220;WSDL-based&#8221;.</p>

<h3>Message-oriented Web services</h3>

<p>While the RPC style was originally very popular within the Web
services community, in recent times there&#8217;s been a shift towards the
idea of message-oriented (or document-oriented) Web services. With
this style, the fact that SOAP and XML are used on the wire becomes
more explicit and more visible to the developer; rather than talk
about RPC requests and responses, one talks about messages and
documents. Intermediaries, as defined in the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/soap12-part1/#msgexchngmdl">SOAP processing model</a>,
play an important role during processing of messages. Whether HTTP or
some reliable messaging technology, such as a MOM system, is used to
transport messages from one processing node to the next is considered
an implementation detail. It is debatable whether the interface (WSDL)
plays a central role in this variant; obviously, though, the <em>message</em>
is the most important concept. Recently, there have been attempts to give this style <a href="http://savas.parastatidis.name/2004/11/09/92ede84c-ca1f-41ab-8feb-8ba50d07e86f.aspx">a new name</a>; oversimplifying again, I&#8217;ll call it
&#8220;SOAP-based&#8221;.</p>

<h3>REST</h3>

<p>Finally, there&#8217;s <a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~fielding/pubs/dissertation/top.htm">REST</a> (REpresentation State Transfer), the
architecture behind the Web itself. The key construct in REST is the
<em>resource</em>, which is identified by an address taking the form of a
<a href="http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc2396.html">URI</a>. Resources support a generic (uniform) interface, in case of HTTP
consisting of the verbs GET, PUT, POST, and DELETE. With
machine-to-machine communication, the resource representations are
usually encoded as XML; it is debatable whether they might take the
form of SOAP messages. In any case, the central concept is the
resource; this style is also the only one to use HTTP as it is
intended to be used: as an application protocol, not as a transport
protocol. It is thus not an oversimplification to label this style
&#8220;HTTP-based&#8221;.</p>

<p>In the next three parts of this mini-series, I&#8217;ll explore the WSDL-,
SOAP- and HTTP-based approaches to SOA, highlighting both advantages
and disadvantages.</p>

<p>Interesting.  We&#8217;ll see where you go with this, but I&#8217;d say that REST is at least as concerned with messages as Message-orientation.  Certainly most of its constraints are connector (message) constraints.</p>

<p>I picked the resource concept as the distinguishing factor for REST because it&#8217;s missing in the other two; but of course you are right that the lines are not as easy to draw as I try to make them appear :-)</p>
