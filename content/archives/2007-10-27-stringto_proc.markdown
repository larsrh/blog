<p><a href="http://weblog.raganwald.com/2007/10/stringtoproc.html">Reg Braithwaite</a> has published String#to_proc, which translates Ruby-like code expressions (in string from) to <code>Proc</code>s. Very neat &#8212; a little DSL that can be used wherever you need to quickly create a chunk of code to pass around.</p>
