<p><a href="http://www.cafeconleche.org/#July_31_2008_75251">Elliotte Rusty Harold</a> on the bad idea that&#8217;s <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2008/WD-exi-20080728/">Efficient XML</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>They&#8217;re some nice graphs and tables that make EXI sounds like a good idea when taken at face value, but some of the claims the documents makes for XML are simply false; and some of the goals it sets for EXI are actively harmful (specifically the ones that involve schema awareness.) I&#8217;m getting a little verklempt. Talk amongst yourselves. I&#8217;ll give you a topic: a Efficient XML Interchange is neither efficient, XML, nor interchangeable. Discuss!</p>
