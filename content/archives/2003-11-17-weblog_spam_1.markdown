<p>Related to the <a href="/blog/st/archives/000415.html">MT-Blacklist</a> anti-comment-spam plugin, Mark Pilgrim&#8217;s cynical, hopeless, and pretty brilliant <a href="http://diveintomark.org/archives/2003/11/15/more-spam" title="Weblog spam [dive into mark]">post on weblog spam</a> is definitely worth reading. </p>

<p>I still have hope that using even semi-efficient measures just might make this spam channel unattractive enough to be ignored.</p>
