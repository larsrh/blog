<p><a href="http://www.zempt.com/" title="Zempt :: Multi-platform posting for Movable Type :: Zempt">Zempt</a> is a tool to post blog entries to <a href="http://www.movabletype.org">Movable Type</a>. I don't think it's a lot different from a couple of alternatives (like w.bloggar, for example), but what's nice is that you can call it via a bookmark or favorite.</p>
