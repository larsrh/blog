<p>Via <a href="http://www.markbaker.ca/2002/09/Blog/2005/12/16#deliciousdistobj.Noelios___Restl...eased">Mark</a>, I came across <a href="http://www.restlet.org/">Restlets</a> &#8212; a programming model and API for building RESTful applications in Java. My excitement is somewhat limited, but that may change once I spend a little more time with it (this year&#8217;s christmas project is building a REST reference app in Java, and though I planned to do it using servlets and JSPs only, I think I&#8217;ll give this stuff a try, too).</p>

<p>While taking a look at the Restlet docs, I came across <a href="http://www.mortbay.com/MB/log/gregw/?permalink=Jetty6Continuations.html">this 3 month-old post</a> from <a href="http://jetty.mortbay.org/jetty/">Jetty</a> creator <a href="http://www.mortbay.com/people/gregw/">Greg Wilkins</a> to find out that Jetty 6 does continuations &#8212; very cool.</p>
