<p>One of the things I did during the Christmas holidays, apart from spending much time with my family, was to finally learn Python. <a href="http://www.diveintomark.org">Mark Pilgrim</a>&#8217;s <a href="http://www.diveintopython">Dive Into Python</a> book (highly recommended) provided a great learning resource, and MacPython is a pretty neat environment.
My goal was not to learn the language to be able to develop something with it in the near future (in fact, I sadly don&#8217;t spend much time programming, these days), but to find out how it compares to other languages, and to gain a deeper understanding about why so many people like it.
My personal take: It&#8217;s pretty nice, I love the functional aspects (like map/filter/reduce), I don&#8217;t care much for the syntax (especially concerning the OO features - I have no problem with using indentation instead of braces). If there were no other restrictions, political, economical, market-wise, etc., I&#8217;d still prefer using Lisp or Scheme; as both are not really acceptable in most customer projects, Python might be a good choice.
I&#8217;ll take a look at Ruby next - people tell me I will like its syntax better. We&#8217;ll see.</p>
