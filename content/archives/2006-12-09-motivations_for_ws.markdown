<blockquote>
<p>If you can&#8217;t suspend your assumptions about how things ought to work to understand how they do work in a different environment, e.g. MOM or REST, you&#8217;ll forever be frustrated and not understand the advantages and disadvantages of this approach over any other. From my perspective on the recent ROA/SOA thread, this is where we are and why reaching any sort of common understanding is and will continue to be so difficult.</p>
