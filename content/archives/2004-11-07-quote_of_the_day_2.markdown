<p>The Eclipse Project has posted the <a href="http://download.eclipse.org/downloads/drops/S-3.1M3-200411050810/eclipse-news-all-M3.html">third milestone of Eclipse 3.1</a>, an open source integrated development environment (IDE) for Java. It also doubles as a base platform for your own applications, an alternative to the AWT and Swing, and a powerful floor wax and dessert topping.</p>
