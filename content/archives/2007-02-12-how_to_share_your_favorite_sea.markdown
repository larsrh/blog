<blockquote>
<p>If you need to help someone by sending a list of interesting web pages that could solve his/her problems, you can do that using <a href="http://www.google.com/gn">Google Notebook</a>. You can do this even without installing the extension. First, create a new notebook. Then use Google to find relevant sites. Every time you find something interesting, go back to the search results and click on &#8220;Note this&#8221;, next to the corresponding search result.</p>
