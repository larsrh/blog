<p>The first (and probably only time) I find myself agreeing with <a href="http://archive.scripting.com/2004/05/14#playingRealGoodForFree">Dave Winer</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Yesterday we saw people complain about spending $60 for a big useful piece of software like Movable Type. I paid $60 for a cab ride in Geneva. A good dinner is $100. A hotel room $150. You want the software, find a way to help companies like Six Apart instead of making them miserable. You've now got the tools to communicate. Use them well. Use them better.</p>
