<p><a href="http://www.25hoursaday.com/weblog/2008/03/05/IndefiniteHiatus.aspx">Interesting</a>. It doesn&#8217;t take much imagination to think that somebody with the Borg cube must have taken issue with some of Dare&#8217;s writings. I&#8217;ll definitely miss posts from one of my favorite MSFT bloggers, particularly since you could always feel that his postings were never influenced by any marketing BS.</p>

<p>At the end of the article Dare links to an earlier posting which says, &#8220;The final straw for me surprisingly hasn&#8217;t been work related&#8230; What I didn&#8217;t expect to have to deal with was people back home in Nigeria reading my blog.&#8221;</p>

<p>Since that article ends, &#8220;I&#8217;m not sure what I&#8217;m going to do next but thought it only fair to let the couple thousand folks who read this blog regularly to know why it stopped if it does stop,&#8221; I presume that by linking to this article Dare means to say that this is indeed why he&#8217;s pulling the plug.</p>

<p>Dare is probably better-known within Nigeria than within Microsoft, and if he says that Nigeria was the problem I&#8217;ll take his word for it.</p>
