<p>I'm very much looking forward to the <a href="http://www.restful-webservices-cookbook.org/2009/04/announcing-restful-web-services-cookbook/">RESTful Web Services Cookbook</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I am happy to announce that Mike Amundsen and I are writing a book titled RESTful Web Services Cookbook. This will be published by Oâ€™Reilly by the end of 2009.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Knowing some of the stuff <a href="http://www.subbu.org/">Subbu Allamaraju</a> and <a href="http://www.amundsen.com/">Mike Amundsen</a> have written, I'm confident I'll be recommending this a lot.</p>
