<p><a href="http://modrails.com/index.html">This is more than cool</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Phusion Passenger — a.k.a. mod_rails — makes deployment of applications built on the revolutionary Ruby on Rails web framework a breeze.</p>

<p>If this works as advertised, I can't imagine how it could <em>not</em> become the default Rails deployment option in a manner of weeks.</p>

<p>For testing purposes, I moved a couple of small / low traffic rails apps to mod_rails. Until now they perform quite well. Memory consumption dropped significantly. The trade off seems to be a small extra time for spawning an rails instance when there wasn&#8217;t a request in some time. But as soon, as the process is up and running, the sites seem to be faster.</p>
