<blockquote>
<p>The next big phase is Type Checking. This is a group of zealous academics (and their groupies and/or grad students) who believe that they can write programs that are smart enough to figure out what your program is trying to do, and tell you when you&#8217;re wrong. They don&#8217;t think of themselves as AI people, though, oddly enough, because AI has (wisely) moved beyond deterministic approaches.</p>
