	  <p>Savas has written <a href="http://savas.parastatidis.name/2005/05/26/e8507db9-b6bc-459d-8735-fd524bd8b7a9.aspx">a very good post on MEST</a> &#8212; this time, I find it hard to disagree with anything he&#8217;s written. Has my perception changed, or is it that he phrases things a little differently?</p>

<p>Here are the points he lists about MEST:</p>

<ul>
<li>There are no directly bindable resources and hence no bindable state (or state representation). This, of course, does not mean that there is no state in our distributed application. It&#8217;s just that state is not bindable;</li>
<li>There are no &#8216;clients&#8217;, &#8216;servers&#8217;, &#8216;consumers&#8217;, etc.; only services that exchange one-way messages;</li>
<li>There are no concepts like &#8216;object&#8217;, &#8216;resource&#8217;, &#8216;interface&#8217;, &#8216;operation&#8217;, &#8216;inheritance&#8217;;</li>
<li>Messages are combined in interesting ways to create protocols;</li>
<li>Application semantics are associated with protocols (descriptions of how messages with well-defined structure can be combined).</li>
<li>It is possible and desirable to associate semantics with the data transferred as payload of messages (e.g. using RDF or a specification document for a particular namespace written in English)</li>
</ul>

<p>I&#8217;m not entirely sure I understand the first point, but the rest makes a lot of sense to me.</p>
