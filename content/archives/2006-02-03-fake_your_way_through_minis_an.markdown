<p><a href="http://www.snee.com/bobdc.blog/2006/02/selfpublishing_bound_hardcopy.html">Bob DuCharme</a> has made his excellent Operating Systems Handbook available<a href="http://www.snee.com/bob/opsys.html"> online in PDF format</a> &#8212; containing great introductions to more arcane OSs such as VM or MVS (I have used the former in the past, but never had a chance to actually do anything with z/OS ne&#233; MVS). Highly recommended.</p>
