<p>Great post from <a href="http://www.windley.com/archives/2006/10/when_you_pick_your_tools_pick_those_that_can_build_tools.shtml">Phil Windley</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Programmers should be tool builders. If you&#8217;re not building tools to make your life easier, you&#8217;re wasting time. [&#8230;] I was thinking about this the other day and concluded that it must be awful to not know how to program. You&#8217;re at the mercy of other people to build your tools. I&#8217;d hate it. It would be like not knowing how to drive.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I totally agree. When I work together closely with others, I always get silently mad when I notice them typing in the same things again and again, reformatting lines and lines of almost identical text by hand, using a UI to repeat the same file-rename operation over and over &#8230; granted, there are times when I spend hours automating what I would have been able to do by hand in minutes, but that&#8217;s the exception. Or so I hope.</p>
