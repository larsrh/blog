<p><a href="http://blogs.tedneward.com/2008/01/30/Highlights+Of+The+LangNET+Symposium+Day+Two.aspx">Ted Neward</a> about Microsoft&#8217;s Erik Meijer:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Erik Meijer: It&#8217;s obvious why Erik is doing his talk at 9AM, because the man has far more energy than any human being has a right to have at this hour of the morning. Think of your hyperactive five-year-old nephew. On Christmas morning. And he&#8217;s getting a G.I. Joe Super Bazooka With Real Bayonet Action(TM). Then you amp him up on caffeine and sugar. And speed.</p>

<p>If you&#8217;ve ever listened to a talk by Erik (which I highly recommend), you&#8217;ll agree that this is a most accurate description of the guy :-)</p>
