<p>I finally got around to reading <a href="http://dev2dev.bea.com/articles/JSchneider_XML.jsp">John Schneider's article</a> about BEA's ECMAScript/XML extensions. This makes a lot of sense to me, and once ECMA has finalized its <a href="http://www.ecma-international.org/news/ECMA%20E4X%20Final%20Final.pdf">extensions</a>, this has the potential to become the dominant way to work with XML.</p>
