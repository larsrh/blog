<blockquote>
<p>A comment thread on a blog post I can no longer find a link to saw a rosy future for Microsoft because they spend nine times as much on research and development as Apple. There's the problem. Microsoft pour R&amp;D money into multi-touch interfaces and come up with a table that is relegated to tech demos and gimmicky election coverage. Apple put R&amp;D money into multi-touch and produce the frickinâ€™ iPhone.</p>
