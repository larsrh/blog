<blockquote>
<p>I have been dealing with the problems of internationalization (i18N) in order to make applications world-ready for over a decade now. In fact, many years ago, my first community presentation was “Internationalisation and Globalisation in Visual Basic 6”.<br /><br />There has recently been a discussion on the <a href="http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/rest-discuss/">[rest-discuss]</a> list titled <a href="http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/rest-discuss/message/12006">“Conneg for language selection: Just Say No”</a>. I wrote a lengthy response on the thread and thought that there was value converting that into a blog entry.</p>
