<blockquote>
<p><a href="http://rb-appscript.rubyforge.org/index.html">Ruby appscript</a> (rb-appscript) is a high-level, user-friendly Apple event bridge that allows you to control scriptable Mac OS X applications using ordinary Ruby scripts. Appscript makes Ruby a serious alternative to Apple&#8217;s own AppleScript language for automating your Mac.</p>
