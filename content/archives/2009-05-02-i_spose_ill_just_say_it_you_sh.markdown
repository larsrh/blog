<p><a href="http://blog.wekeroad.com/blog/i-spose-ill-just-say-it-you-should-learn-mvc/">Rob Conerey</a> tells it like it is:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><b>The Great Lie</b> <br />WebForms is a lie. It’s abstraction wrapped in deception covered in lie sauce presented on a plate full of diversion and sleight of hand. Nothing you do with Webforms has anything to do with the web – you let it do the work for you.<br /><br />This, friends, is a big deal (at least to me): You’re working in a lie. The web is <em>not</em> stateful and works with this stuff called HTML sent across wires using another thing called HTTP – you need to know this, love this, and feel it at the bone level.</p>

<p>This is my main problem with many of the &#8220;advanced&#8221; Web frameworks in the Java space, too. For more, check out <a href="http://www.infoq.com/news/2009/05/should-devs-learn-aspnetmvc">Jon Arild Tørresdal&#8217;s news item</a> on InfoQ.</p>
