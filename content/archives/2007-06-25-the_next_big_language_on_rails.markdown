<blockquote>
<p>In an effort to increase developer productivity at Google, <a href="http://steve-yegge.blogspot.com/">Steve [Yegge]</a> tried to convince the company to adopt Rails (and consequently Ruby) as a programming language. When that fell on deaf ears (Google really does not want to increase the number of languages that must be supported by their infrastructure), Steve decided to do what any other frustrated programmer would do: he ported Rails to JavaScript. Line by line. In 6 months. Working 2000 hours.</p>

<p><em>Wow.</em></p>
