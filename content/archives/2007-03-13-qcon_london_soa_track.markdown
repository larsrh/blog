<p>Wednesday morning, I&#8217;m going to leave for London to go to <a href="http://qcon.conference.com/">QCon</a>, the first conference organized by InfoQ and EOS (the folks behing JAOO), where I&#8217;m host of the SOA track. I&#8217;ll only have a very small part in the show, <a href="http://qcon.infoq.com/qcon/speakers/show_speaker.jsp?oid=151">the track introduction</a> (which I&#8217;m going to do together with <a href="http://qcon.infoq.com/qcon/speakers/show_speaker.jsp?oid=161">Miko</a>), but I somehow managed to gather together an extraordinary line-up of SOA speakers:</p>

<ul>
<li>Anne Thomas Manes, <a href="http://qcon.infoq.com/qcon/speakers/show_speaker.jsp?oid=117">&#8220;The Business Value of SOA&#8221;</a>;</li>
<li>Paul Downey, <a href="http://qcon.infoq.com/qcon/speakers/show_speaker.jsp?oid=197">&#8220;Is the Web &#8216;Good Enough&#8217; for Web Services?&#8221;</a> (who was kind enough to take over from Steve Vinoski)</li>
<li>Steve Jones, <a href="http://qcon.infoq.com/qcon/speakers/show_speaker.jsp?oid=144">&#8220;SOA Driving IT from the business&#8221;</a></li>
<li>Paul Fremantle, <a href="http://qcon.infoq.com/qcon/speakers/show_speaker.jsp?oid=158">&#8220;Making XML and Web Services real for the enterprise&#8221;</a></li>
<li>Jim Webber, <a href="http://qcon.infoq.com/qcon/speakers/show_speaker.jsp?oid=160">&#8220;Guerilla SOA&#8221;</a></li>
</ul>

<p>I&#8217;m also very much looking forward to the talks of <a href="http://qcon.infoq.com/qcon/speakers/show_speaker.jsp?oid=185">Mark Nottingham</a> and <a href="http://qcon.infoq.com/qcon/speakers/show_speaker.jsp?oid=139">Werner Vogels</a>. Check out the other tracks, too - with Martin Fowler, Eric Meijer, Ted Neward, Christian Weyer, Cameron Purdy, Cedric Beust, Kevlin Henney, Zed Shaw, Dave Thomas, and many, many more, I believe this conference is going to be close to incredible.</p>
