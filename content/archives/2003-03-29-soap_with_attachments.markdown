<p>This document proposes a set of concrete idioms and conventions that clarify the processing model of SOAP Messages with Attachments, yielding the following enhancements: *	Alignment with the XML Infoset-based data model and the SOAP processing model &iuml;&iquest;&#144; opaque data may be correctly processed by intermediaries and may be secured*	Backwards-compatible message syntax &iuml;&iquest;&#144; every message conforming to this proposal is a legal SwA/1.0 message*	Alternate message syntax for SOAP processors that have no knowledge of SwA or this proposal &iuml;&iquest;&#144; message content can be faithfully serialized in a form that is understandable by SOAP processors that do not comply with this specification</p>
