<p>If I were a Mac programmer, I would reserve 48 hours of my life for <a href="http://gusmueller.com/macsbironcoder/">this contest</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>First the API is given, and you have 24 hours to read up and get comfy with it. Then the theme is announced, and you start coding! And you better have it done within 24 hours because that&#8217;s all the time you get.</p>
