<p><a href="http://www.systinet.com">Systinet</a> has released <a href="http://www.systinet.com/products/wasp_jserver/overview">WASP Server for Java, 4.7</a>. There&#8217;s a whole bunch of new stuff in it, most notably support for standard XML schemas such as FpML, HL7 and Open Financial Exchange, (simple) runtime validation against XSDs, structured SOAP faults, a SOAP GET binding (cool!) and wrapped literal mode.</p>
