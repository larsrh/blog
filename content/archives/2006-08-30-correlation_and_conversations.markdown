<p>As you might guess from my last post, I&#8217;m going through <a href="http://www.eaipatterns.com/gregor.html">Gregor Hohpe</a>&#8217;s old articles. Another great posting: <a href="http://www.eaipatterns.com/ramblings/09_correlation.html">Correlation and Conversations</a>, including a cool explanation why introducing message correlation can lead to a bad re-invention of the call stack. I wonder why these postings never crossed my radar &#8212; this particular post got just one link (according to <a href="http://www.technorati.com/search/www.eaipatterns.com%2Framblings%2F09_correlation.html">Technorati</a>). Is it because people associate Gregor with EAI instead of SOA?</p>
