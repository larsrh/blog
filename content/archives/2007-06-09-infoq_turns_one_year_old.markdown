<p>I&#8217;ve been involved with <a href="http://www.infoq.com">InfoQ</a> for a year now, too &#8212; what do you think? Has it been worth it? I&#8217;d be very interested in your comments and suggestions, either here or <a href="http://www.infoq.com/news/2007/06/infoq-birthday">over there</a>. BTW: If you feel there&#8217;s something missing in terms of SOA-related content, we&#8217;re always looking for article suggestions &#8230;</p>
