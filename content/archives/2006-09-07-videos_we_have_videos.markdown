<p>InfoQ now (finally) features videos &#8212; while still beta, clearly the coolest video playing feature I&#8217;ve seen, with simultaneous views of the presenter and the slides <a href="http://www.infoq.com/presentations/JRuby">in this talk about JRuby</a>.</p>

<p>A few glitches when I tried to access it: first time, the audio started twice, out of synch. The second and third time, the audio and video of the presenter were fine, but the slides never advanced past the title slide.</p>

<p>Also, the video of the presenter doesn&#8217;t add a lot of value, especially considering that I can&#8217;t view it and the slides at the same time on my 1024x768 laptop screen.</p>

<p>What OS are you using? I know that sometimes, a refresh is needed, but I haven&#8217;t noticed the other glitches. With regards to the slides and the presenter, I disagree that it adds no value in general. It very much depends on the presenter :-)</p>

<p>Thanks for the comment, in any case - I&#8217;ll pass it along.</p>

<p>Thanks. It seems to me much improved now - I&#8217;d appreciate a comment once you&#8217;ve watched another (or even the same) video.</p>
