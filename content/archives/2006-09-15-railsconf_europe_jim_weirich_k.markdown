<p><a href="http://onestepback.org/">Jim Weirich</a> is the creator of rake, the Ruby make tool (which is a very neat example of a Ruby DSL). He gave a talk on library design in Ruby, mostly centered around some rules like using namespaces, preserve essential behavior when using Ruby hooks and so on (hopefully the slides will be up soon).</p>

<p>Update: Added link, sadly no slides yet.</p>
