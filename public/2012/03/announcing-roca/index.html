	  <p>In the past few days, we finally managed to write down a few ideas on
Web frontend design, basically a set of rules to apply if the goal is
to come up with a Web app that is actually <em>on</em> the Web as opposed to
be <em>tunnelled through</em> the Web. We tried to come up with a catchy
name, and finally arrived at &ldquo;<a href='http://roca-style.org'>ROCA</a>&rdquo;, a
conveniently pronouncable acronym for &ldquo;Resource-oriented
client architecture&rdquo;.</p>

<p>I am aware that for many folks, specifically those who are interested
in REST and thus likely to read this, a common reaction might be
&ldquo;Duh&rdquo;. And one of the main things I&rsquo;d like to stress is that we have
not invented a single thing, but rather collected a certain set of
rules that we found many people liked, but couldn&rsquo;t name.</p>

<p>Since we started discussing this, we&rsquo;ve found strong support, as well
as violent opposition. Which is exactly what we were looking for,
because in only very very few cases, people didn&rsquo;t understand what we
described, and that&rsquo;s the whole point of the effort: Give a name to a
certain cohesive set of practices so that they may used as a reference
both when you agree with them, want to build a system that adheres to
them or criticize them because you disagree.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m looking forward to comments over at the <a
href='http://roca-style.org/discussion.html'>discussion page</a>. If
you believe we should make changes, please <a
href='https://github.com/innoq/ROCA'>fork the GitHub repo</a> and
create a pull request.</p>
