<blockquote>
<p>We also have put JBoss Rules to work with JavaSpaces. It works quite well because it is POJO based and the compiled rules can just be put into the space as Entries. If that isn&#8217;t h.o.t. I don&#8217;t know what is. We have a generic worker that takes Entries out of the space &#38; reads the appropriate rules files. It just asserts the Entries directly into the rules engine (they are POJOs too - Entry is just a marker). No XML marshalling / mapping madness etc. Just objects - neat!</p>

<p>Neat indeed. So much stuff to play with, so little time &#8230;</p>
