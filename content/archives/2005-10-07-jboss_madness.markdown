<p>I advised Matthias Bohnen, who is managing director of a company we have friendly relations with, against partnering with JBoss Inc. more than a year ago. In this case, I hate to have been right &#8212; but it seems that if your company advertises its JBoss <em>consulting services</em> without being a JBoss partner, you&#8217;re in for a surprise: they&#8217;ll come after you suing you for trademark violations!</p>

<p>Obviously, the guys there seem to have a rather strange view on what open source, and more importantly, free software is about (after all, JBoss&#8217;s source code is published under the LGPL.) Find out more about <a href="http://thejbossissue.blogspot.com/">the JBoss issue here</a> .</p>

<p>You&#8217;re mistaken, this practice is already condoned - enterprise Linux distros has been doing that for a while.</p>

<p>I disagree that this is comparable &#8212; it would be if it were Linus Torvalds who sued people who offer &#8220;consulting for Linux&#8221; without his consent.</p>

<p>It must have something to do with the &#8220;Commercial Open Source&#8221; tagline. Defend your brand as your core property.</p>

<p>Interesting homepage - after a machine translation. :) Are you looking at the Geronimo-based SOA stack?</p>

<p>Miguel: Sorry about the missing English version, as 99% of our customer base speaks German, the company website is likely to remain in German for quite some time. No, we&#8217;re not currently looking at the Geronimo stack, but it&#8217;s likely to come up soon.</p>
