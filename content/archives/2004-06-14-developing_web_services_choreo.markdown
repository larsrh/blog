<p><a href="http://www.ebpml.org/">Jean-Jacques Dubray</a>, whom I can&#8217;t link to correctly because I can&#8217;t find the URI for the relevant blog entry in his newsfeed, points to this excellent <a href="http://www.workflow-research.de/Publications/index.html">paper by zur Muehlen, Nickerson and Swenson about BPM standards, REST, and SOAP</a> &#8212; truly fascinating not because of its technical merits (although it has those as well), but because of the analysis of how standards get created.</p>

<p>Hi Stefan,</p>

<p>I&#8217;m glad you found the paper and thank you very much for the positive comments - they are much appreciated. You may be interested to know that we published a second paper at a workshop last year that deals with the issue of standardization in a more general sense. A journal version of this paper is currently under review. The original workshop paper can be downloaded here: <a href="http://www.workflow-research.de/Publications/JENI.MIZU-ICIS-WS(2003).pdf" rel="nofollow" /><a href="http://www.workflow-research.de/Publications/JENI.MIZU-ICIS-WS(2003).pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.workflow-research.de/Publications/JENI.MIZU-ICIS-WS(2003).pdf</a></p>

<p>Best regards</p>

<p>Hi Stefan,</p>

<p>Glad you found the paper, and thanks for the nice comments. You may be interested to know that Jeff and I wrote a second paper on the issue of web services standardization, which focuses more on the game theoretic moves of standards players. A revised version of this paper is currently under revision by an academic journal, but a workshop version of the paper can be downloaded at <a href="http://www.workflow-research.de/Publications/PDF/JENI.MIZU-ICIS-WS(2003).pdf" rel="nofollow" /><a href="http://www.workflow-research.de/Publications/PDF/JENI.MIZU-ICIS-WS(2003).pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.workflow-research.de/Publications/PDF/JENI.MIZU-ICIS-WS(2003).pdf</a></p>

<p>Best regards</p>

<p>Michael</p>
