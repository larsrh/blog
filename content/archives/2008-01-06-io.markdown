<blockquote>
<p>Io is a dynamic prototype-based programming language.

<blockquote>
<p>Io is just an incredibly hushed secret. (Perhaps because it is impossible to Google stuff about it.) Did you know that Ioâ€™s introspection and meta tricks put Ruby to serious shame? Where Ruby once schooled Java, Io has now pogoed. </p>
