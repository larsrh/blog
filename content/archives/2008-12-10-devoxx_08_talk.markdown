<p>I've put up my <a href="/blog/st/presentations/2008/2008-12-10-REST-Patterns--Devoxx.pdf">slides on REST patterns and antipatterns</a> (warning: 12 MB PDF) from this year's Devoxx conference, which I actually liked a lot.</p>

<p>Hi</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Nice presentation</p></li>
<li><p>All such presentations , imho, reduce the importance of REST as an interface model and make people think of implementing everything in REST as a filesystem like thing , which leads to roy.gbiv.com/untangled/2008/paper-tigers-and-hidden-dragons</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Although you haven&#8217;t been THAT guilty (your slide on HATEOAS , don&#8217;t concentrate on URI design etc. is a good beginning), I think a lot more needs to be done.</p>

<p>@anonymous: You are right. I did spend some time on the topic, but I agree there&#8217;s a high risk people mistake REST for crud and ignore this aspect. </p>

<p>Hello,</p>

<p>Thanks for the slides. And BTW congratulations for your presentation, this was clear &amp; efficient, exactly what I do not get when I ask &#8220;what is <b>exactly</b> REST ?&#8221;</p>

<p>Colin I do believe but Stafan presenatation will be available at Parleys but from my onw experience you must be very very patient.
Just a few presentations from Spring One 08 are now available but we were all assured that all of them will be avaiable in 2 months after conference&#8230;</p>
