<p><a href="http://blog.jclark.com/2007/04/validation-not-necessarily-harmful.html">James Clark</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I believe that the right kind of validation can make interoperability over time more robust than the alternative, simpler approach of having an implementation just ignore anything that it doesn&#8217;t need.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is mostly in response to Mark Baker&#8217;s <a href="http://www.coactus.com/blog/2006/12/validation-considered-harmful/">Validation Considered Harmful</a> post; I wonder what James would have to say about Dave Orchard&#8217;s <a href="http://pacificspirit.com/Authoring/Compatibility/">work on versioning</a>, especially his <a href="http://www.xml.com/pub/a/2004/10/27/extend.html">XML Schema thoughts</a> (and, to a lesser degree, his <a href="http://www.xml.com/pub/a/2006/12/20/a-theory-of-compatible-versions.html">theory of compatible versions</a>).</p>
