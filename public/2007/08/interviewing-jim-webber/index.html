	  <blockquote>
<p>In this interview Jim Webber, Service-oriented Systems Practice Lead at ThoughtWorks, explains his ideas behind &#8220;Guerilla SOA&#8221; &#8211; a somewhat agile approach to SOA that relies on small steps instead of a large-middleware-centric route towards service-enabling an enterprise. Jim also advocates MEST (MESsage Transfer), an architectural style that focuses on messages the same way REST focuses on resources. In Jim&#8217;s opinion, the problem with most current Web services stacks are rooted in WSDL&#8217;s notion of operations, which he deems to be the wrong abstraction for SOA. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I had a chance to interview Jim at QCon London, and it was definitely a lot of fun &#8212; I can agree with most, if not all, of Jim&#8217;s views (except some of his REST misconceptions, of course :-) &#8230; more on <a href="http://www.infoq.com/news/2007/08/jim-webber-interview">InfoQ</a>.</p>
