<p>I just <em>love</em> <a href="http://fakesteve.blogspot.com/2008/05/that-crazy-old-economy-can-be-so.html">Fake Steve's Fake Jonathan Schwartz</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>More important, the MySQL deal has demonstrated our commitment to the open source community and gained us huge amounts of good will from people who don't like to pay for things, which for a company in our dire situation is absolutely invaluable.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Brilliant.</p>

<p>Why is it brilliant that Daniel Lyons continues to spread his lies, bias and misconceptions about the free software community?</p>

<p>Considering Sun&#8217;s open source strategy weird doesn&#8217;t require lying, being biased, or any misconception.</p>

<p>You&#8217;re twisting my words. Daniel Lyons is openly against the whole free software movement. When he characterises the community as people who &#8220;don&#8217;t like to pay for stuff&#8221; he&#8217;s deliberately misusing the word &#8220;free&#8221; which is talks about liberty and not price.</p>

<p>If we ignore this, his underlying thesis, that free software is a barrier to making profit, is clearly also false. I&#8217;m not going to insult you or your readers by presuming I have to name any of the large companies who make massive profits with free software.</p>

<p>Noah, I don&#8217;t take &#8220;Fake Steve&#8221; serious &#8212; this is satire, after all. I find it funny, not all the time, but most of the time, even if &#8220;Steve&#8221; expresses opinions I don&#8217;t share.</p>
