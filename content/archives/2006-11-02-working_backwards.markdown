<p><a href="http://www.allthingsdistributed.com/2006/11/working_backwards.html">Werner Vogels</a> describes the process used at Amazon.com to introduce new products. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The product definition process works backwards in the following way: we start by writing the documents we&#8217;ll need at launch (the press release and the faq) and then work towards documents that are closer to the implementation.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This seems like an amazingly simple and cool idea to me.</p>

<p>Of course, it would be even more interesting if Amazon actually did things that way&#8230;</p>

<p>It&#8217;s interesting, and certainly better than &#8216;the 1000 Commandments Specification&#8217;, bit isn&#8217;t it a little Big Upfront Spec?</p>

<p>Where&#8217;s the agile/iteration love in all this?</p>

<p>Interesting comment, AC; I often feel that some of Werner&#8217;s descriptions are a little too great to be true. Given that you&#8217;re anonymous and he isn&#8217;t, though, his credibility ranks quite a bit higher &#8230;</p>

<p>David: I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s like a big upfront spec at all &#8212; a press release will just capture what&#8217;s most important to your potential users in a page or two. Whether they do it or not, I believe it&#8217;s a good idea to get your intentions communicated clearly &#8230;</p>
