<p><a href="http://www.snee.com/bobdc.blog/2006/05/download_as_spreadsheet.html">Bob DuCharme explains</a> a neat trick to provide an &#8220;Excel export&#8221;, based on sending HTML with an appropriate MIME type. I remember one of my colleagues using this trick in a project; much easier than any <a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/poi/">POI</a> or other more complex solution, and often just as effective.</p>

<p>Bob,
When you &#8220;export&#8221; and HMTL table in this way, are there any limitations to the amount of data in each cell? </p>

<p>Our HTML table will contain a cell with nearly 6 pages of data. What will be the limitations opening up a the file in Excel?</p>

<p>Thank you for a quick response,
Asha</p>
