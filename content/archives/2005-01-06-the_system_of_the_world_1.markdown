<p>I just finished <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0060523875/">The System of the World</a> &#8212; part three of Neal Stephenson&#8217;s 3000-page Baroque Cycle. Truly, truly brillant.</p>

<p>Now I can finally take a look at <a href="http://www.cafeaulait.org/systemoftheworld.html">EHR&#8217;s pages</a> without the risk of spoilers! (Don&#8217;t click that link unless you have read all three parts ;-))</p>
