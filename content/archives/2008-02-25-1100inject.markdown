<blockquote>
<p>And whether you love open classes or hate them, whether you can think of a way to use them or whether you think there is always a better way, the indisputable truth about them is that Rubyists are using them to evolve the language from the bottom up, to find new ways to do things. Good things, bad things, beautiful things, ugly thingsâ€¦ they are all New Things.</p>
