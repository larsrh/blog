	  <p>I finally managed to connect my iPod to my car's audio system, using <a href="http://www.densionusa.com/x/index.php?option=content&#38;task=view&#38;id=375&#38;Itemid=79">Dension ICELink</a>. My car has an Audi Symphony II with a built-in 6-CD-changer, and no support for direct line-in -- apparently, it will only accept audio signals on the line-in port if an external CD changer signals its presence on the car's internal bus. That's what the ICElink does.</p>

<p>Sound quality is excellent, I can step through songs with the control keys in the radio, integration with the GPS system and the cell phone support is supposed to work as well (haven't tried that yet) - all in all, pretty neat.</p>

<p>2005 UPDATE:</p>

<p>After reading your post I purchased the IceLink adapter. I really wanted it to work just like yours, but the new IceLink&#8217;s lock the iPod&#8217;s controls and display and force you to use special playlists and the radio buttons for &#8220;safty&#8221; reasons.</p>

<p>With a little more reasearch and talking to Dension (who was hard to get a hold of) I found out there is a website <a href="http://www.mp3yourcar.com/" rel="nofollow" /><a href="http://www.mp3yourcar.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.mp3yourcar.com/</a> where they have adapters that allow full control and display on the iPod still&#8230; lower price too. </p>

<p>re;2005 update.
If you got a dension you already have the option to have full control of the ipod through its normal functions ( although not reccomended by dension incase you crash).
You should have this option detailed in the instructions.
if not their website has the manual</p>

<p>Ok, according to John Gravin the adapter from <a href="http://www.mp3yourcar.com/" rel="nofollow" /><a href="http://www.mp3yourcar.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.mp3yourcar.com/</a> costs less than the Dension ICELink, which is not true. What gives?</p>
