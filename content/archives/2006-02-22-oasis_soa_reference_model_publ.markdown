<p><a href="http://www.oasis-open.org/committees/download.php/16628/wd-soa-rm-pr1.pdf">This 28 page document</a> [PDF] from OASIS aims to describe a reference model for SOA [via <a href="http://www.markbaker.ca/2002/09/Blog/2006/02/21#deliciousdistobj.Reference_Model..._PDF_">Mark Baker</a>; here is <a href="http://lists.oasis-open.org/archives/tc-announce/200602/msg00013.html">the announcement</a>].</p>

<p>I only spend a few minutes with it, and I&#8217;m not too impressed &#8212; it seems rather vague and shallow to me. But I seem to have a bad SOA week, I&#8217;ll try to post a more informed opinion in a few days &#8230;</p>

<p>Indeed, one must question the usefulness of any document that proudly states (and I&#8217;m paraphrasing slightly from lines 38-39 here):</p>

<p>&#8230;the reference model &#8230; is at least three levels of abstraction away from a physical entitity &#8230;</p>

<p>Talk about architecture astronautics or what?!</p>

<p>Not just a week, I&#8217;ve been having a bad SOA 18 months.  Whatever a SOA is, and for all the hype, I still haven&#8217;t seen a precise description of exactly <em>what</em> the business benefits are, <em>how</em> SOA achieves them and therefore <em>why</em> it is a &#8220;good thing&#8221;.</p>

<p>The available glib explanations, such as those in Section 2.3 of this document just don&#8217;t cut it with me.  I am still waiting to see concrete explanations of exactly how a SOA approach (uniquely) solves any real problems involved with the creation, integration, migration and replacement of IT systems.</p>
