<blockquote>
<p>That pretty much wraps up this installment. The bottom line: As we approach JRuby 1.0, our performance is better than it&#8217;s ever been&#8212;faster than Ruby 1.8 for many specific cases, with stellar across-the-board performance right around the corner. And with other implementations like Ruby 1.9, XRuby, Rubinius, and Ruby.NET rapidly coming of age, Ruby&#8217;s future is looking extremely solid.</p>
