<p><a href="http://www.josiahcole.com/2007/02/14/a-webmasters-19-commandments/">Josiah Cole</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I&#8217;ve compiled a small list (or rant) of some very basic and fundamental rules that all webmasters must learn and respect when developing a website that needs to make actual money. This list can also be used by companies looking to hire a web development firm or to evaluate an already deployed website project.</p>

<p>Excellent advice [via <a href="http://www.windley.com/archives/2007/05/stupid_web_design_tricks.shtml">Phil Windley</a>]</p>
