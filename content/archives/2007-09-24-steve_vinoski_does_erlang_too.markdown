<p><a href="http://steve.vinoski.net/blog/2007/09/23/tim-bray-and-erlang/">Steve Vinoski</a> improves upon <a href="http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2007/09/22/Erlang">Tim Bray&#8217;s code</a> and tries out different configurations:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>As we increase the number of Erlang processes, our performance improves, up to a point. At 40,000 processes we&#8217;re slower than we were at 4000. Maybe there&#8217;s a better number in between? It turns out that despite the numbers listed above, once you get above 400 processes or so, the numbers remain about the same. The best I got on my MacBook Pro after numerous runs was 0.301 seconds with 2400 processes, but the average best seems to be about 0.318 seconds.</p>
