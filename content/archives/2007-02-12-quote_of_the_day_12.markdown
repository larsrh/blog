<p>A great quote from Alan Kay:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>But just to show how stubbornly an idea can hang on, all through the seventies and eighties, there were many people who tried to get by with &#8220;Remote Procedure Call&#8221; instead of thinking about objects and messages.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It if had only been the seventies and eighties &#8230;</p>
