<p>An interesting story about <a href="http://lemonodor.com/archives/001301.html">Reddit</a>&#8217;s move from Lisp to Python and the associated <a href="http://www.findinglisp.com/blog/2005/12/reddit-and-lisp-psychosis.html">psychosis</a> exposed by the Lisp community.</p>

<p>In any case, I&#8217;m sure <a href="http://www.aaronsw.com/">Aaron Swartz</a>&#8217;s <a href="http://webpy.org/">web.py</a> is going to be interesting &#8230;</p>
