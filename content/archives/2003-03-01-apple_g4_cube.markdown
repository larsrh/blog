<p>My favorite machine is my G4 Cube, running Mac OS X 10.2 (Jaguar).<br />

Although it's no longer in production (you can find some ome <a href="http://www.apple-history.com/frames/body.php?page=gallery&model=g4cube">historical information here</a>), I still believe that it's the coolest machine I ever had - and probably will have as well. Mac OS X just rocks, and I'm continuously thinking of replacing my trusted ThinkPad with a Mac notebook.</p>
