<p>A co-worker complained to me that my blog has become pretty silent. That's true, particularly because I now post a lot of the quick stuff I used to put here <a href="http://twitter.com/stilkov">to Twitter</a>.</p>

<p>I'm not really happy with this; I think it would be nice to have at least the links I tweet appear here automatically. So I'm looking for good options of achieving this â€¦ Right now I'm considering to build a simple app of my own that I can use to store links with comments, and then sync that over to both Twitter and this blog. How do others integrate their del.icio.us links, tweets and blog posts into a single place? Without giving the password for one service to the other?</p>

<p>FWIW, I had Twitter linked to Facebook for a while and the tweets didn&#8217;t really mix with the updates.  Twitter (at least for me) was becoming dependent on hash tags to keep subject contexts alive.  On other sites, that context was either lost or people had to go back to Twitter to figure it out.  But I totally agree that it&#8217;s easier to tweet than to blog.</p>

<p>Hi Stefan,</p>

<p>See <a href="http://tech.puredanger.com/2009/03/30/ruby-twitter-link-script/" rel="nofollow">http://tech.puredanger.com/2009/03/30/ruby-twitter-link-script/</a> for a script to generate a weekly blog post with your twitter links. I don&#8217;t use it myself, but Alex blog shows that it works ;)</p>

<p>I use twitterfeed to post selected del.icio.us bookmarks to twitter, see <a href="http://blog.bit.ly/post/99778795/sync-bit-ly-delicious-twitter" rel="nofollow">http://blog.bit.ly/post/99778795/sync-bit-ly-delicious-twitter</a> for a how-to.</p>
