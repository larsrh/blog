<p>An <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2005/05/04/bea_to_triple_in_size/">amazingly ridiculous analysis</a> of BEA&#8217;s announcement to triple in size (all you have to do is announce this? If I had only known that earlier). I don&#8217;t know how serious &#8220;Bloor Research&#8221; expects to be taken, but writing a brown-nosing piece like this surely kills all credibility. &#8220;ICE&#8221;, my ass.</p>
