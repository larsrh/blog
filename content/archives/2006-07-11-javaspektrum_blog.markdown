<p>As some of you may know, I have started writing a monthly blog column for the German <a href="http://www.sigs-datacom.de/sd/publications/js/index.htm">JavaSPEKTRUM</a> magazine, which I consider to be an interesting experiment &#8212; blogs and print media don&#8217;t usually mix that well. We&#8217;ll see &#8230;</p>

<p>If you read German, you can find the online blog, which I&#8217;ve recently started to maintain a little more even in between print editions, <a href="http://www.sigs.de/blog/js/">here</a>.</p>
