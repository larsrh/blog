	  <p><a href="http://staff.newtelligence.net/clemensv/">Clemens Vasters</a>&#8217;s company, <a href="http://www.newtelligence.com/">newtelligence</a>, did a debrief of new information gathered at the Microsoft PDC in LA. It was a very interesting evening. It was fun to meet Clemens, whose blog I have been following for quite some time now, in person. The beer was free (sponsored by MS), so the basic human needs were covered.</p>

<p>Contrary to the agenda in the invitation, Clemens was the only speaker, which was fine by me &mdash; he is easy to listen to, seems to be as knowledgable as one can be about technology that is only a few weeks old, and did a good job covering the essential news of Longhorn, Microsoft&#8217;s new OS due to be released some time in 2006 (God willing, that is). </p>

<p>So thanks to newtelligence and Clemens for doing this! I had read quite a bit about Longhorn before, and I assume most everybody reading this will have done so, as well. Nevertheless, here&#8217;s my brief, and very personal summary of what I found interesting &#8230;</p>
