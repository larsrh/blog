<blockquote>
<p>[Weblog comments] are a part of the problem, not the solution. You don&#8217;t have a right to post your thoughts at the bottom of someone else&#8217;s thoughts. That&#8217;s not freedom of expression, that&#8217;s an infringement on their freedom of expression. Get your own space, write compelling things, and if your ideas are smart, they&#8217;ll be linked to, and Google will notice, and you&#8217;ll move up in PageRank, and you&#8217;ll have influence and your ideas will have power.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is very convincing in principle. I have to say, though, that the (relatively few) comments I get here on this blog are truly worth reading &#8212; check <a href="/blog/st/comments.xml">out the comment feed</a>.</p>

<p>I do like principles, but the developer promoting the practicality in me wins out in this case. My gut feeling is forcing people to post on their blog goes against how people &#8220;work&#8221;. The perceived mental barrier for posting a blog entry is too high. Also, many people don&#8217;t have blogs and the comments might not be relevant to the topic of their blog.</p>

<p>As has become more and more the case, I don&#8217;t agree with Joel at all.  I agree with Dan &#8212; it&#8217;s about barrier to entry.  There is a spectrum here, ranging from something like Twitter on the one hand, to publication quality on the other.  All of these &#8220;levels&#8221; of communication have and add value, and make up what has been called the &#8220;conversation&#8221;.  I think Joel&#8217;s just flat out wrong.</p>

<p>I also think this ties in with something James Governor said recently about Romanticists vs. Classicists:</p>

</ul>

<p>Frankly, it smells to me like a command-and-control vs. open, egalitarian participation thing.  Who cares about the &#8220;Fuckwad&#8221;s?  In what way do stupid comments detract from the value of the original piece or reflect in any way on the author?  This kind of wrong-headed thinking is why I stopped reading Joel.  Open comments allow that one, occasional, brilliant comment to come along, and make the rest worthwhile.  Who reads all the dross anyway?  That&#8217;s what a scrollbar is for.</p>

<p>Full disclosure:  I am exposed on this issue, cause JRoller has some mechanism that I&#8217;ve never bothered to figure out that closes comments on my posts after a while.  Sigh.  If Joel reads this, he might be tempted to play that up and accuse me of hypocrisy &#8212; which would be missing the point.</p>
