<p>As usual, I find it very easy to agree with <a href="http://blog.springframework.com/arjen/archives/2007/03/27/ws-duck-typing/">Arjen Poutsma</a>  &#8212; he suggests to use duck typing for building Web services, and offers three tips:</p>

<ol>
<li>Don&#8217;t validate incoming messages!</li>
<li>Use XPath!</li>
<li>Don&#8217;t create stubs or skeletons!</li>
</ol>

<p>Good advice. I&#8217;ve written <a href="/blog/st/2005/05/20/web_services_and_postels_law.html">similar things</a> in the past; see also entry #6 <a href="http://www.infoq.com/articles/tilkov-10-soa-principles">here</a>.</p>
