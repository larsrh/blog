<p><a href="http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/">Tim Bray</a> <a href="http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2003/07/17/BrowserDream" title="ongoing - The Door Is Ajar">talks about browsers</a>, and I believe he's written another essay that'll be /.ed soon. There is one single thing that makes me still use IE on Windows, as much as I would like not to - it's the only browser that is embeddable in applications such as FeedDemon, SharpReader and others. That's a really powerful option, so perhaps it would be a great idea to write a decent COM interface to Mozilla or FireBird for the Win32 platforms.</p>
