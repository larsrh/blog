<p>Following up on <a href="/blog/st/2009/05/integrating_linksblog_poststwe.html">yesterday's thoughts</a> (thanks for the comments, BTW), I've made some changes to my blog - it's been a while; I forgot how easy it is to waste time doing so without any tangible benefit whatsoever â€¦ anyway; there's now an autodiscoverable link to <a href="http://twitter.com/statuses/user_timeline/5325152.rss">my Twitter updates feed</a>, as well as a small piece of JavaScript (pulled from <a href="http://remysharp.com/2007/05/18/add-twitter-to-your-blog-step-by-step/">this excellent posting</a>) that will pull the last ten tweets (excluding @replies) into the home page for those who visit the main index page instead of using the Atom or RSS feed. Hope you like it, tell me if you don't.</p>
