<p>Phil Ringnalda <a href="http://philringnalda.com/blog/2004/05/licensing_matters.php">dissects</a> <a href="http://www.movabletype.org">MovableType</a>&#8217;s license agreement (I wonder - did he do this with the license agreement of all the other software he&#8217;s using?). <a href="http://diveintomark.org/archives/2004/05/14/freedom-0">Mark Pilgrim&#8217;s post</a> on his switching from MT to Wordpress gets translated into different languages. All over the weblogging world, people are switching from MT to something else, write bitter posts about SixApart&#8217;s evilness, how they&#8217;ve been betrayed &#8230; have all of them gone completely nuts? </p>

<p>Seeing the reaction of the blogosphere, just because somebody wants to make money with a good product, will kill many good product ideas, simply because nobody will want to deal with this crap.</p>

<p>No, I didn&#8217;t and won&#8217;t read every word of the licenses for all the software I use. Of all the strange and terrible things to do, I use Outlook Express for email (locked down, and demoronized, thank you), because I just don&#8217;t care about email. I use Windows because it works with the cheap hardware I have, and there&#8217;s rarely a program I want to run that isn&#8217;t available for it. In both cases, if MS did something to the license to make it impossible for me to use anymore, I really wouldn&#8217;t care. Happy to have a reason to move on. Or, if I&#8217;m violating the license using it in what I think is a reasonable way, I don&#8217;t much care about that, either.</p>

<p>But there are things I do care about: PuTTY (&#8220;you may do any damn thing you want, as long as it isn&#8217;t suing us because it didn&#8217;t work like you expected&#8221;), HTMLKit (&#8220;you may do anything other than redistribute it, and don&#8217;t sue us&#8221;), and Firefox (&#8220;you may do about anything, and if you sue us you&#8217;ll be very very sorry&#8221;). The MPL is insanely tangled, thanks to its history with Netscape, but the effective meaning is pretty well known. The other two? PuTTY is completely and utterly free, HTMLKit isn&#8217;t, but they both very simply and clearly state the minimum that you can and can&#8217;t do, include the minimum boilerplate to cover themselves, and that&#8217;s it.</p>
