<p>Via the <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/service-orientated-architecture/">SOA mailing list</a>, I came across <a href="http://bijonline.com/PDF/carlson%20%20tyomkin.pdf">this article</a> that appeared in <a href="http://www.bijonline.com">business integration magazine</a>. It&#8217;s nice to see that people start writing more than introductory texts on SOA, although I did not find anything particularly new in this one &mdash; I am reminded of the beginning of the J2EE hype 4 or 5 years ago, where it took people some time to gain enough experience with the technology to write about architectural issues and every text written about the topic was essentially the same &#8230;
One issue discussed in the article came up multiple times in my own work in the last few weeks: Whether or not to use UDDI to enable an SOA, and if one decides to use UDDI, how to solve the registry vs. repository issue; I&#8217;ll follow up on that in another post.</p>
