<p><a href="http://www.neward.net/ted/weblog/index.jsp?date=20050402#1112440457600">Ted Neward</a> is taking a look at Lisp. I can only recommend to do so if you haven&#8217;t been exposed to Lisp or Scheme before &#8212; while it&#8217;s highly unlikely you&#8217;ll ever use it in practice, unfortunately, it&#8217;s highly educating; and there&#8217;s very few IDEs that are as great for learning a language as <a href="http://www.drscheme.org/">DrScheme</a>.</p>
