<p>Harold Varmus, president of the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, shared a Nobel Prize for studies of cancer viruses, and wrote a <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2003/07/06/movies/06VARM.html" title="Virus as Metaphor: Microbiology and '28 Days Later'">review about '28 Days Later'</a>.</p>

<p>Despite a huge amount of seriously flawed logic, I still liked it a lot. My advice would be to not convince somebody who's not into horror movies to accompany you ... unless you want to break the friendship.</p>
