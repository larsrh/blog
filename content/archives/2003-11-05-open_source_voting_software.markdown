I remember from a discussion about a year ago with a potential German customer who built a system for use in German elections (not that I can recall it ever having been used) that they were actually <em>forced</em> to use only Open Source software by the state government.</p>

<p>If you&#8217;re a supporter of Open Source Voting, please help out the Open Voting Consortium. They&#8217;re not only development a software system that implements touscreen voting with voter verified paper ballots, they&#8217;re working with numerous states to advance the use of open source voting systems.</p>
