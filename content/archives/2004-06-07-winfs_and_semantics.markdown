<blockquote>
<p>Microsoft is telling us to disregard the grassroots Office XML strategy, which is here now and doesn&#8217;t lock us in, in favor of the ivory-platform WinFS strategy, which is years away and does lock us in. If a compelling argument can be made for the second approach, I haven&#8217;t seen it yet.</p>
