<p>I just downloaded and installed <a href="http://www.hutteman.com/weblog/2003/04/06.html#000056" title="public virtual MemoryStream: April 06, 2003 Archives">SharpReader</a><a>, and from my first impression, this seems to be the ultimate RSS aggregator. Great! You've made my day! Exactly what I was looking for.</a></p>
