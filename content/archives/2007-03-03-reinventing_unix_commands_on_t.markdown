<blockquote>
<p>One of my favorite business model suggestions for entrepreneurs is, find an old UNIX command that hasn&#8217;t yet been implemented on the web, and fix that. <code>talk</code> and <code>finger</code> became ICQ, LISTSERV became Yahoo! Groups, <code>ls</code> became (the original) Yahoo!, <code>find</code> and <code>grep</code> became Google, <code>rn</code> became Bloglines, <code>pine</code> became Gmail, <code>mount</code> is becoming S3, and <code>bash</code> is becoming Yahoo! Pipes. I didn&#8217;t get until tonight that Twitter is <code>wall</code> for the web. I love that.</p>

<p>I also like this one from the comments:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><code>chown</code>: ebay.com</p>
