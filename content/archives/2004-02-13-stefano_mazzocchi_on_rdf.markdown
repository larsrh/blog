<p><a href="http://www.betaversion.org/~stefano">Stefano Mazzochi</a> has a nice <a href="http://www.betaversion.org/~stefano/linotype/news/46/">posting</a> on RDF:</p>

<blockquote>Relations are tables, XML documents are trees, and, guess what, RDF models are graphs. Yep, you got it, RDF candescribe both.</blockquote>

<p>A beautiful blog layout, BTW.</p>
