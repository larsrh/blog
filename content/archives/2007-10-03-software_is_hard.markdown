<blockquote>
<p>Why is software in a never-ending state of crisis?  Why do most projects end up horribly over-budget or cancelled or both?  Why can&#8217;t we ship code without bugs?  Why, everyone asks, can&#8217;t we build software the same way we build bridges?</p>

<p>A great article about software construction (via <a href="http://www.dehora.net/journal/2007/10/links_for_20071003.html">Bill de hÓra</a>).</p>
