<p><a href="http://webpages.charter.net/chrisfer/2005/03/11-0.html">Chris Ferris</a> about Carlos Perez&#8217;s posts I linked to <a href="/blog/st/2005/03/05/rest_benefits.html">before</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>REST is an architectural style. SOAP is a message format with a well defined processing and extensibility model. Comparing the two is like comparing HTTP with HTML.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Needless to say, I couldn&#8217;t agree more.</p>
