<p><a href="http://savas.parastatidis.name/2004/04/06/199840d6-7d98-46d3-8e53-a89aec756685.aspx">Savas Parastatidis links</a> to an <a href="http://www.sys-con.com/story/?storyid=44354&#38;DE=1">article</a> he co-authored about this subject.</p>

<p>I strongly believe that there actually <em>is</em> a difference between SOA-style Web services and Distributed Objects, and I even share some of Savas&#8217;s thoughts. But I don&#8217;t think WSDL is a good candidate for making this point, since with its reliance on XML Schema it&#8217;s probably the least flexible and most static part of the whole Web services architecture.</p>
