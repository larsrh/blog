<p>After <a href="http://www.digitalmars.com/d/">D</a>, which I came across a couple of weeks ago, I now found the <a href="http://www.skyhunter.com/marcs/ewalnut.html">E language</a> (via <a href="http://patricklogan.blogspot.com/2004/05/innovation-in-privacy-and-security.html">Patrick Logan</a>). Some very nice ideas, including built-in support for secure distributed computing; while nice, I believe what we really need are programming languages that make extensions seem like first-class concepts &#8212; the case for which is made in this <a href="http://www.third-bit.com/~gvwilson/xmlprog.html">paper by Greg Wilson</a>.</p>
