<p>This is fascinating: I have made it to <a href="http://duckdown.blogspot.com/">James McGovern</a>&#8217;s blogroll, under the friendly heading &#8220;folks I mentor&#8221;. (With <a href="http://www.loudthinking.com/">DHH</a>, <a href="http://www.jroller.com/page/obie">Obie</a> and <a href="http://www.cincomsmalltalk.com/blog/blogView">James Robertson</a>, I feel in good company.) Whatever you think of him, his arrogance his impressive :-)</p>

<p>James is a self-proclaimed &#8220;though leader&#8221;. I recall having linked to him <a href="/blog/st/2006/03/26/enterprisey.html">once before</a>, but have since refrained from it, mostly because I found all of his writing to be too ignorant to be worthy of being mentioned.</p>

<p>That reminds me&#8230; must remember to put James Gosling on the list of folks I mentor&#8230;.</p>

<p>Simply attempting to add lesser-known bloggers to my blogroll as a call to action by confusedofcalcutta.com. Couldn&#8217;t think of a category name so I simply put this as a placeholder.</p>

<p>Please do not encourage others to amplify this, as folks will get it twisted&#8230;</p>

<p>Lesser-known bloggers such as David Heinemeier Hansson, whose blog outranks yours at Technorati by about 24000 places?</p>
