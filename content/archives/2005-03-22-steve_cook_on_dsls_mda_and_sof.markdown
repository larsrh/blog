<p>There&#8217;s an <a href="http://dnjonline.com/article.aspx?ID=mar05_stevecook">interesting interview</a> with Microsoft&#8217;s <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/stevecook/">Steve Cook</a> up on <a href="http://dnjonline.com/default.aspx">DJNOnline</a>. Too bad the industry is wasting so much effort on a totally pointless flame war again &#8212; as if <a href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?ComVsCorba">one time</a> wasn&#8217;t enough.</p>

<p>I was trying not to make it a flame war. I think there are some valid distinctions to be made, and I was attempting to make them.</p>

<p>BTW when I did the personality test, I came out as Albert Einstein.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m sorry Steve, I didn&#8217;t mean to imply you did. At least not here :-)</p>

<p>I&#8217;m pro-MDA in the sense of being a fan of automating tedious tasks, enabling developers to tweak their tool set to meet their needs, express themselves in the language most suitable for the task &#8230; all of which are, IMO, common characteristics of MDA, the Software Factory approach, and good old Lisp macros.</p>
