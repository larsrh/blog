<p>Sam Ruby points to the <a href="http://www.intertwingly.net/blog/1490.html" title="Road Map">Road Map</a> for creating a new weblog syndication format, developed as a joint effort by a number of impressive people. Being rather new to all of this weblog stuff, I've started out to find out what the motivation for this is; one of the best sources for RSS's history is written by <a href="http://diveintomark.org/archives/2003/06/21/history_of_rss_date_formats.html">Mark Pilgrim</a>. I'll risk one prediction for the name, though: Unless someone comes up with, and the others agree on, a decent name or abbreviation, it's going to be called "Pie" - simply because people will start referring to it this way and there'll be no chance to stop it ;-)</p>
