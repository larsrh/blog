	  <p>Tim Bray recently linked to <a href="http://www.roughtype.com/archives/2007/04/citi_whacks_it.php">an interesting post</a> by Nick Carr &#8212; according to him, Citigroup plans to cut $4.6 billion from their IT budget over the next three years. His conclusion:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In the short run, the rationalization wave could be good news for IT vendors - at least some of them - as it will involve investing in the modernization of IT plants and equipment. But in the longer run, the trend at the top tier of the enterprise market is clear: IT spending is going down.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The intent seems to somehow imply that this is bad for the IT industry &#8212; after all, Nicholas Carr is the author of the rather famous <a href="http://www.nicholasgcarr.com/articles/matter.html">IT Doesn&#8217;t Matter</a> article. But this seems a total <em>non sequitur</em> to me &#8212; getting rid of unnecessarily complex, efficient and needlessly redundant crap is <em>good</em> for the industry as a whole. I believe this is only going to hurt those who deliver something at high prices without appropriate value &#8212; which, admittedly, is true for many, but definitely not all IT vendors.</p>
