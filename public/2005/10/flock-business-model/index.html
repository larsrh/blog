	  <p>I haven&#8217;t yet found the time (or energy) to play with <a href="http://flock.com">Flock</a>, the Firefox-based Social Web 2.0 Browser, but I find <a href="http://www.decrem.com/bart/2005/10/creating-sustainable-value/">this &#8220;explanation&#8221;</a> of the business model rather funny: </p>

<blockquote>
<p>So here&#8217;s the plan: we&#8217;re going to experiment and innovate.&#160; We plan to make a ton of mistakes, listen to our users, focus on building the best product that meets our users&#8217; needs.&#160; Where there are obvious, proven, opportunities to generate revenues in ways that respect our users&#8217; privacy and don&#8217;t hinder the user experience, we will pursue those.&#160; But we firmly believe that doing right by our users is the best way to build a sustainable, successful company, so expect us to focus pretty much all of our energy on innovating the web browser experience and earning your trust.&#160;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Translation: <em>We don&#8217;t have the slightest clue yet how to ever turn this into a profitable business, but hey, who cares, let&#8217;s just see if we can&#8217;t find some big company dumb enough to drown us in a few billion $ sooner or later.</em></p>

<p>its not fair to pick solely on flock in this regard, as far as i can tell, very few of the web2 companies have any pretension at making money beyond some piipedream of being acquired. this has serious implications - do you store your photos on one the flick-off buildouts, your calendar at kiko etc, knowing that its quite likely that at some point the founders will get tired of paying the hosting fees and turn it off? it bothers me slightly that netvibes (a site i love and use daily) doesn&#8217;t seem to be exploring revenue at all. at some point the developers are going to tire of paying the hosting fees.</p>
