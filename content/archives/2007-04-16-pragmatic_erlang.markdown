<p>Interesting <a href="http://pragdave.pragprog.com/pragdave/2007/04/a_first_erlang_.html">stuff from Dave Thomas</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>One of the joys of playing at being a publisher is that I get to mess around with the technology in books as those books are getting written. Lately I&#8217;ve been having a blast with Joe Armstrong&#8217;s new Erlang Book. At some point I&#8217;ll blog about the really neat way the Erlang database unifies the set-based SQL query language and list comprehensions (it&#8217;s obvious when you think about it, but it blew me away when I first read it). But I just wanted to start off with some simple stuff.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This sounds very much like <a href="/blog/st/2007/03/14/qcon_london_2007_erik_meijer_on_linq.html">LINQ</a>. </p>

<p>Other than that, Erlang feels extremely weird at first sight. Which  is actually great, since without a doubt it means I&#8217;m going to learn something when <a href="/blog/st/2007/04/16/innoq_events.html">we take a closer look</a> next month :-)</p>

<p>two things:</p>

<p>mnesia - awesome, worth knowing the language for</p>

<p>headed lists - most people are concerned with stuff like closures and listcomps, but headed lists are beautiful.</p>
