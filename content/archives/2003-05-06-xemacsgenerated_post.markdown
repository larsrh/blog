<p>I'm still doing some experiments with XEmacs and mt.el. <a href="http://www.xemacs.org">XEmacs</a> is probably still the best editor in the world, and it's strange that I still remember most of the keyboard shortcuts after not having used it for a year or so. Probably like bycicling - once you learned it, it's almost impossible to forget it.<br />
I finally got around to downloading and installing it again, and sure enough quicky googled up an <a href="http://www.marginalia.org/log/">MT-capable Weblog editing mode</a>. So now I can post from XEmacs, replacing the next-to-useless HTML area functionality in IE with a decent editor.</p>
