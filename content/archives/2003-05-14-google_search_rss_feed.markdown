<p>Somebody has to have built this already: Every few days, I monitor google hits for specific terms, such as a specific company or product name - most likely some I'm affiliated with to find out whether there is anybody linking or talking about this. <br />
So the basic idea is this: Allow for a service that performs a search for a particular list of words, and returns the result formatted as an RSS newsfeed to be used in RSS aggregators. Preferably usable from everywhere and everyone ... <br />
Note that I'm not talking about Googlenews, I'm aware of a service that does this (although I have lost the link).</p>

<p>Google Alert essentially does this <a href="http://www.googlealert.com/" rel="nofollow" /><a href="http://www.googlealert.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.googlealert.com/</a> . All you need is a Google API key , which means you&#8217;re limited to how many queries/updates you can do.</p>

<p>This is one of three sources of RSS feeds I need to add to my RSS page <a href="http://www.faganfinder.com/me/" rel="nofollow" /><a href="http://www.faganfinder.com/me/" rel="nofollow">http://www.faganfinder.com/me/</a> .</p>

<p>If anyone knows of other sources for Google RSS feeds, I&#8217;d like to hear about those.</p>

<p>Oops, wrong URL. Instead of /me/ it should be <a href="http://www.faganfinder.com/search/rss.shtml" rel="nofollow" /><a href="http://www.faganfinder.com/search/rss.shtml" rel="nofollow">http://www.faganfinder.com/search/rss.shtml</a> .</p>

<p>This looks like exactly what I was looking for! Thanks a lot. BTW, the current FAQ states that having one&#8217;s own Google Web API key because Google has donated one for permanent use with this service.</p>

<p>Google is coming up with a feed search and I tried and wrote some content on my blog <a href="http://www.rss-syndication.info/blog/?p=42" rel="nofollow" /><a href="http://www.rss-syndication.info/blog/?p=42" rel="nofollow">http://www.rss-syndication.info/blog/?p=42</a></p>

<p>Its not really an official announcement from Google, but kind of URL discovery working with google personalized homepage.</p>
