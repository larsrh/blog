<blockquote>
<p>It&#8217;s sad that&#160;as an industry we built a technology on an eXtensible Markup Language (XML) and our first instinct was to make it as inflexible as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_Computing_Environment">technology that is two decades old</a> which was never meant to scale to a global network like the World Wide Web.&#160;</p>
