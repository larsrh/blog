I very rarely blog about stuff like this, but <em>Identity</em> is a very, very cool movie. I really like it if filmmakers avoid insulting their viewers&#8217; intelligence &mdash; and this is one of those plots that just doesn&#8217;t do this.
Be sure to watch the DVD extended version, which has a subtly different ending.
