	  <p>Funny, today I had a discussion with a colleague about legal options for distributing music, and then I come across <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2004/06/07/mercora_p2p_radio/">this article</a> about something related &#8212; a peer-to-peer broadcasting network. </p>

<p>Our idea, which probably isn&#8217;t new and has lots of legal problems we didn&#8217;t think about, went roughly like this: Since it&#8217;s legal to give a CD one has bought to somebody else, who can listen to it and then return it &#8212; because the owner can&#8217;t listen to it while he&#8217;s given it away, and clearly lending your CDs to somebody else for free can&#8217;t be illegal &#8212; it should be possible to do something equivalent over the web.</p>

<p>This would be like a sort of floating license &#8212; only one person can listen to a particular song at any one time. Users would transfer their right to listen to music over the web instead of physically, but I can&#8217;t see any legal difference. If songs are so popular that many people want to listen to them simultaneously, the provider would simply buy more licenses &#8230; does this make any sense? Probably not, so it&#8217;s a good thing we&#8217;re not in the music business :-)</p>

<p>Yeah, that made sense. But I do have one question.
What do you think about uploading music, say to Putlife.com., and post links on a message borads? Will that count as an Illegal Music Distribution? &#8216;Cause I don&#8217;t think it would.</p>
