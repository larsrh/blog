<blockquote>
<p>I just used a feature of Rake that is not available in any other build tool that I know. Namely, I added an action to an existing task1. This feature allows you to extend the behavior of a task that you do directly own. Say for example, ones defined by the framework you are using.</p>

<p>Rake is neat even if you don&#8217;t use Ruby or RoR as your main language; see <a href="http://www.martinfowler.com/articles/rake.html">Martin Fowler&#8217;s excellent intro</a> if you don&#8217;t know it yet.</p>
