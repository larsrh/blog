	  <p>These are my unedited notes from Mark Little's talk at QCon London 2008.</p>

<ul>
<li>Observes that the talks have been sort of an anti-climax</li>
<li>Some history about distributed computing (skipping some here)</li>
<li>In the late 1960s/1970s, spending months to integrate four machines</li>
<li>RPC invented in the early 1970s</li>
<li>RPC is NOT dead, neither is it pining for the fjords</li>
<li>RPC still running a lot of backend systems</li>
<li>1990, some physicist invented the World Wide Web</li>
<li>Back then: "What does he know that we don't? How dare he? How could he come up with something when he's not even a computer scientist?"</li>
<li>1999, Web Services were invented</li>
<li>CORBA's biggest problem: Microsoft not involved</li>
<li>Firewall vendors won't open up to CORBA or DCOM (dynamic ports), so we'll show them</li>
<li>HTTP is a useful 'transport' after all</li>
<li>2000-2005: spent 5 years going backwards to distribution transparency - it feels like 1970 all over again</li>
<li>Distribution must be explicit, otherwise you're not able to deal with failures</li>
<li>Same fundamental laws, for Web services, WWW, CORBA, DCOM:
<ul>
<li>Develop "entity", define the unit of work it supports</li>
<li>Search for the entity</li>
<li>Request entity to perform unit of work</li>
<li>maybe try to make the remote interaction local</li>
<li>maybe do some "enterprise" stuff as well (security, transactions, replication)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Different approaches
<ul>
<li>EDA</li>
<li>SOA</li>
<li>Message-oriented (MOM, Pub/Sub)</li>
<li>Tuple Spaces</li>
<li>RPC</li>
<li>sync/async</li>
<li>group communication</li>
<li>There is no such thing as a global panacea!</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Problems with tight coupling introduced by trying to make a remote interaction look like a local interaction</li>
<li>Explanation of client/server stubs/skeletons</li>
<li>Definition of SOA: Not purely technology, an architectural style trying to achieve loose coupling</li>
<li>Services as re-usable units</li>
<li>Explicitly not CORBA w/ angle brackets, coarse-grained services</li>
<li>SOA has two architectural constraints:
<ul>
<li>A small set of ubiquitous interfaces to all participating agents, only generic semantics -- often based on specific, but doesn't have to be</li>
<li>Descriptive messages, described by schema</li>
<li>sounds vaguely REST-like</li>
</ul></li>
<li>At one extreme: very specific service interfaces, akin to IDL</li>
<li>At the other extreme: (e.g. single operation doWork)</li>
<li>There are degrees of coupling (not intended to evoke sexual associations ;-) and you should choose the level that's right for you</li>
<li>Shows picture of OSI 7 layer model (only known to people with grey hair)</li>
<li>With a uniform interface, your application has to do more</li>
<li>The same requirements are present throughout the stack</li>
<li>split differently between the application and the infrastructure</li>
<li>uniform interface enables generic infrastructural asupport</li>
<li>specific interface allows for more limited generic support</li>
<li>developers have to do less</li>
<li>REST over HTTP
<ul>
<li>original HTTP 0.9 had only GET</li>
<li>now HTTP has 8 methods</li>
<li>HTTP is NOT a transport</li>
<li>Often stated that HTTP/REST is only suitable for hypertext</li>
<li>Weak argument: nothing inherently limiting machine usage</li>
<li>Extra infrastructure could help (anyone remember URN name servers 1994/1995?)</li>
<li>Google and other search engines are fantastic name servers</li>
<li>Not enough "application" standards -- good point</li>
<li>Lack of good tooling (changed, e.g. via JAX-RS, WCF)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>What about Web services?
<ul>
<li>Began life as CORBA-over-HTTP</li>
<li>Just as easy to develop non-SOA apps in WS as it is to write SOA apps with other tooling</li>
<li>WS-Addressing and WS-RF both good examples of WS not being used for SOA</li>
<li>Web Services and SOA gives benefits</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Enterprise realities</li>
<li>Customers want interop, guaranteed delivery of messages, transactions (not ACID ones), audit trails, bullet-proof security, machine-readable contracts</li>
<li>Shows <a href="/resources/ws-standards-poster/" title="innoQ Resources: Web Services Standards as of Q1 2007">innoQ's WS poster</a> ;-) </li>
<li>Can convey the wrong image -- that you need everything</li>
<li>Standards: The Web is a series of standards, universal adoption has to count for something, REST/HTTP is ubiquitous</li>
<li>application semantic interop is missing</li>
<li>Shows REST transactions by HP in 2000 (!)</li>
<li>Back then, Mark Baker's continuous interruptions in the mailing lists led to this</li>
<li>GET on http://\<machine\>/transaction-coordinator</li>
<li>PUT on http://\<machine\>/transaction-coordinator/begin?clientid will start new tx and return http://\<machine\>/transaction-coordinator/\<id\></li>
<li>Misses standards e.g. for search (ed: what about OpenSearch?)</li>
<li>WS-* has driven portability</li>
<li>clearly defined semantics for transactions, security, reliable messaging -- not specific to HTTP</li>
<li>WS-* vs. REST</li>
<li>Internet-scale computing for WS is no longer being talked about</li>
<li>What can REST learn from WS-*: Uniform interface isn't enough, e.g. support for transactions, in a standardized manner</li>
<li>Popularize HTTP outside the browser</li>
<li>Just because the Web works doesn't make it right for everything (when did you last ride a horse to work?)</li>
<li>Don't abuse transports, they don't like it -- HTTP is NOT a transport</li>
<li>Adopt SOA principles within Web services (no more WS-RF, WS-Context instead of WS-Addressing)</li>
<li>Late binding is good</li>
<li>KISS and make up</li>
<li>Remember the Web uses HTTP</li>
<li>One size doesn't fit all</li>
<li>Use the right tool for the right job</li>
<li>Both the REST and the WS communities should look at the work that has been done in the 80s and 90s</li>
<li>Question: What would you say to people who say "Squid is the ESB"?</li>
<li>Answer: It might work if you're just looking for an EAI framework, but he thinks an ESB is more than that</li>
</ul>
