<p><a href="http://www.oreillynet.com/ruby/blog/2006/03/transformation.html">A great article</a> about the (lack of a need for) refactoring. (Thanks, Jerry.)</p>

<p>I&#8217;ll also admit to one thing: As regular readers know, I&#8217;m a fan of model-driven engineering, MDA, MDSD, and related technologies. Even so, I&#8217;ll be the first to admit that a major part of the use-cases for MDSD/MDA apply to problems <em>that simply don&#8217;t exist</em> when you use a more powerful programming language.</p>
