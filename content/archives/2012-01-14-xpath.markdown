Aristotle Pagaltzis has written <a
href='http://plasmasturm.org/log/xpath101/'>a very nice and concise XPath intro</a>.
 Of all the various standards in the XML ecosystem, I
like XPath best, most of all because it enables interaction with an
XML document or message in a way that matches <a
href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robustness_principle'>Postel's law</a>: It's a great way to implement code that doesn't break each
time a minor change is made to an XML format. In fact I'd say it's one
the few very good reasons to stick with XML instead of adopting JSON
-- even though there are things like <a
href='http://goessner.net/articles/JsonPath/'>JSONPath</a>, they don't
have the tool support and standardization you get from XPath.
