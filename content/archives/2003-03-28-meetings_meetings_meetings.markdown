<p>Just got home after a rather murderous business trip - drove 1200km and visited 3 customers in 36 hours. Interestingly enough, all of the discussions link together. In the first meeting, we discussed how to adapt OSSJ to our MDA product, iQgen; in the second one, we had some interesting discussions about to evangelize MDA. The third and final one centered around MDA as well, but led to a discussion of Systinet's products, too. All of them are interested in what the others do, one might become a customer of the other ... Very interesting times.</p>
