<blockquote>
<p>AWS Import/Export allows you to ship your data on one or more portable storage devices to be loaded into Amazon S3. For each portable storage device to be loaded, a manifest explains how and where to load the data, and how to map file to Amazon S3 object keys. After loading the data into Amazon S3, AWS Import/Export stores the resulting keys and MD5 Checksums in log files such that you can check whether the transfer was successful.</p>

<p>Amazon continues to amaze me with their focus on simply doing the right thing. Impressive.</p>
