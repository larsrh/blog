	  <p><a href="http://patricklogan.blogspot.com/2007/05/misunderstanding-ria-some-more.html">Patrick Logan</a> criticizes <a href="http://wanderingbarque.com/nonintersecting/2007/05/14/the-beginning-of-the-end/">Pete Lacey</a> for his claim that Apollo/Flex is not on the Web:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Here&#8217;s how you do it: write the server as if any kind of web-able client could consume it. Write the client in Apollo or just Flex to consume that server&#8217;s resources.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>While that may be true, I believe that a few years from now, the industry will rediscover the client-side of the Web, all that HTML and CSS and JavaScript stuff that is perceived to be so hard to do, and find out that it&#8217;s actually superior to the desktop application model. <a href="http://korrespondence.blogspot.com/2007/05/apollo-silverlight-blah-blah-blah.html">Mike Dierken</a> puts it best:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You might say that RIA is to user interfaces as RPC is to messaging interfaces : more is not better.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>When you say that HTML/CSS/Javascript is superior to the desktop application model, what do you mean? Easier to develop? Faster? More interactive? Easier to deploy? Morally superior? Blanket statements of this sort aren&#8217;t defensible or useful.</p>

<p>Regardless, I think you are kind of missing the point of RIA: the goal is <em>not</em> to duplicate the desktop application model on the web. In fact, you can build RIAs in HTML/CSS/JavaScript and many have done so already. RIA frameworks like Flex are designed to <em>extend</em> those websites to provide richer graphics and superior interactivity (e.g. Yahoo! Maps) than HTML/CSS can do today (maybe someday pure HTML/CSS will be made to do what Flash can do now, but that day isn&#8217;t here yet). Apollo takes this one step further by bringing HTML/CSS/Javascript directly to desktop applications.</p>

<p>Bottom line is that you&#8217;ve got it wrong: RIAs are all about <em>promoting</em> the web model over the desktop model.</p>

<p>Andrew, to me, the RIA model implies that there&#8217;s something wrong with the way we&#8217;re building Web applications today, and that we need something &#8220;better&#8221;. But I&#8217;m not sure what those problems are &#8212; I haven&#8217;t yet seen a convincing argument of something that can&#8217;t be achieved with a Web UI except for maybe audio and video integration, which &#8212; at least in the use cases I&#8217;m involved with &#8212; plays a very minor role. </p>

<p>But I&#8217;m really not a RIA or Apollo or Flex or Flash expert, so I can&#8217;t really make a qualified statement. I just have this suspicion that it actually adresses a problem we don&#8217;t really have.</p>
