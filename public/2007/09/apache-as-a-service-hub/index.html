<blockquote>
<p>If RESTful architectures catch on and people start to see the web as a series of resources, Apache HTTPD&#8217;s role will continue to grow. It&#8217;s high time we stopped looking at Apache HTTPD as just a web server and started viewing it as an HTTP Gateway.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The Apache web server is not exactly famous for its small footprint (both in terms of configuration and runtime), but I agree it&#8217;s a very viable option for many scenarios.</p>

<p>Yea but httpd is super tiny compared to anything commonly labeled &#8220;hub&#8221; or &#8220;bus&#8221; or anything typically considered &#8220;middleware&#8221; in the Enterprise. I&#8217;ve seen EAI / service bus stuff that could fit all of httpd in the palm of its hand.</p>

<p>That&#8217;s what I find so interesting about the enterprise Java market &#8212; the least complex solutions are often orders of magnitude more complex than the software people in UNIX hacker land consider large and bloated.</p>

<p>I agree with Ryan Tomayko, also to notice that your trackback seems to be disabled but it is advertised both in auto discovery comment and in the visible HTML.</p>

<p>Thanks, I forgot to disable the advertising of it when I disabled trackbacks due to lots and lots of spam.</p>

<p>Of course you&#8217;re both right &#8212; it&#8217;s all a matter of perspective. Compared to a typical ESB or application server product, HTTPD is tiny. Compare to Lighty or Mongrel, it&#8217;s not &#8230;</p>

<p>Apache HTTPD&#8217;s footprint all depends on how you configure, compile and and how you measure memory usage. </p>

<p>Often, footprint measurement for Apache is inaccurate. People look at top or ps output not realizing that the majority of reported memory is shared among all processes, not unique to a process.</p>

<p>Apache can run with Async I/O just as Lighty can and consume a small amount of actual pages, all depends on how you configure it. In all the testing I&#8217;ve done, Lighty slightly lags behind Apache HTTPD in terms of total request handling latency when configured similarly (async I/O, epoll, etc.)</p>

<p>Also, I guess you get what you pay for. Apache HTTPD is capable of several tricks that Lighty can&#8217;t do for scaling up and enhancing reliability (shared SSL symmetric keys for example). Lighty is often good enough, but it&#8217;s not really the end all of HTTPD serving. Limited DAV support and limited virtual hosting compared to Apache HTTP come to mind.</p>
