<p>I&#8217;m not a big fan of <a href="http://www.sun.com">Sun</a>; they drove too many products from companies they acquired into oblivion for my taste. But without a doubt, their <a href="http://www.sun.com/emrkt/trycoolthreads/index.jsp">Try &#38; Buy program</a> is very cool &#8212; especially because they have someone like <a href="http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/">Tim Bray</a> to ensure the boxes get to <a href="http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2006/04/12/Computers-In-the-Right-Places">all the right places</a>.</p>
