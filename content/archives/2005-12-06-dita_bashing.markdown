<p><a href="http://it-and-more.blogspot.com/2005/12/how-to-slow-down-your-project-dita.html">Gernot Starke</a> has some serious criticism of DITA &#8230; Docbook &#8212; which we have used for documenting our own product &#8212; in my experience, is different &#8212; while Gernot has a point with regards to change tracking and embedding of images, I still find the benefits (like being able to output <a href="/iqgen/help-r2.1.0/webhelp/">different</a> <a href="/iqgen/help-r2.1.0/basic-html/">formats</a> from the same source) outweigh the disadvantages.</p>

<p>I strongly agree to this point of view. In the automotive industry some companies defined the MSR standard, an XML-based format in order to exchange technical specifications. </p>

<p>Since it provides no way to exchange common engineering stuff like Simulink models, the funeral of this bullish is (hopefully) quite close. It is just a vehicle to pretend a &#8220;complete and accurate&#8221; spec.</p>

<p>yeah - different output formats might be fine - IF you really need them. In the cases I experienced, only printed paper docu was really required -  and the slow-motion-docu process did imho NOT turn out valuable&#8230;</p>

<p>It is perfectly clear that to exchange structured info, things like DocBook or DITA are fine.</p>

<p>I like docbook. IMO, Gernot misses a couple of points:</p>

<ul>
<li>use emacs. You won&#8217;t need a non-deterministic specialized tool </li>
<li>docbook (and probably dita) are for technical documentation, not for writing your proposal and co-editing it with an accountant. I agree that is next to impossible to make non-techies use it</li>
<li>OTOH, techies will like documenting stuff better (due to higher coolness factor)</li>
<li>DMS not necessary, just use your favorite version control system. this is the principal advantage, BTW. You will then have the desired re-use (at least for glossary, qanda, bibliography, &#8230;) </li>
<li>style sheets etc. are easy; just use your customers layout with your tool chain</li>
<li>it can itself be generated from other (XML) sources; concept is particularly powerful in an MDA environment</li>
</ul>
