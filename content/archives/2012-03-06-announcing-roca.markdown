In the past few days, we finally managed to write down a few ideas on
Web frontend design, basically a set of rules to apply if the goal is
to come up with a Web app that is actually _on_ the Web as opposed to
be _tunnelled through_ the Web. We tried to come up with a catchy
name, and finally arrived at "<a href='http://roca-style.org'>ROCA</a>", a 
conveniently pronouncable acronym for "Resource-oriented 
client architecture".

I am aware that for many folks, specifically those who are interested
in REST and thus likely to read this, a common reaction might be
"Duh". And one of the main things I'd like to stress is that we have
not invented a single thing, but rather collected a certain set of
rules that we found many people liked, but couldn't name. 

Since we started discussing this, we've found strong support, as well
as violent opposition. Which is exactly what we were looking for,
because in only very very few cases, people didn't understand what we
described, and that's the whole point of the effort: Give a name to a
certain cohesive set of practices so that they may used as a reference
both when you agree with them, want to build a system that adheres to
them or criticize them because you disagree.

I'm looking forward to comments over at the <a
href='http://roca-style.org/discussion.html'>discussion page</a>. If
you believe we should make changes, please <a

create a pull request.
