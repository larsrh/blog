<p>For the motivated, here’s a cool project idea. Build a Ruby Goodness WS-* API that can use SOAP4R, WSF/Ruby or Axis/J as the underlying stack. I’d love to see something like that.</p>

<p>A great idea. Some input (I know the XML stuff is orthogonal, but still):</p>

<p>For the record, though, I have to say I actually like the <a href="http://wso2.org/project/wsf/ruby/1.0.0/docs/index.html">WSF/Ruby API</a> &#8212; it&#8217;s quite low-level, but I believe everybody should have learned their lessons about hiding details by now &#8230;</p>
