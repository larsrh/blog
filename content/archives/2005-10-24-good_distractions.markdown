<p>It&#8217;s slightly absurd to blog about this, since I&#8217;ve read the article only because I spent time doing the most unproductive thing one can possibly imagine &#8212; blog reading &#8212; but Paul Ford&#8217;s <a href="http://www.43folders.com/2005/10/24/paul-ford-distractions/">elaboration</a> on his recent <a href="http://www.ftrain.com/Followup.html">distraction post</a> is well worth reading.</p>
