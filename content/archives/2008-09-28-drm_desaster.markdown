<p>Via <a href="http://www.cincomsmalltalk.com/blog/blogView?showComments=true&amp;printTitle=DRM_Sucks,_Reason_9_million&amp;entry=3399981880">James Robertson</a>, wonderful quote from <a href="http://www.boingboing.net/2008/09/26/walmart-shutting-dow.html">Boing Boing</a> on <a href="http://gizmodo.com/5055854/walmart-shutting-down-mp3-store-drm-servers-umpteenth-reminder-to-not-buy-drmd-content">Walmart shutting down its DRM servers</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>But don't worry, this will never ever happen to all those other DRM companies -- unlike little fly-by-night mom-and-pop operations like Wal*Mart, the DRM companies are rock-ribbed veterans of commerce and industry, sure to be here for a thousand years. So go on buying your Audible books, your iTunes DRM songs, your Zune media, your EA games... None of these companies will ever disappear, nor will the third-party DRM suppliers they use. They are as solid and permanent as Commodore, Atari, the Soviet Union, the American credit system and the Roman Empire.</p>
