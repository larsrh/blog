<p><a href="http://dilbert.com/blog/entry/the_geek_tingle/">Scott Adams</a> phrases the only reason I occasionally download stuff illegally:</p>

<blockquote>Dilbert was probably in second place for the most stolen item of the past 20 years, at least by businesses. (Money was in first place.) And who could blame anyone for using Dilbert without permission? I would have done the same thing. Humans have some sort of hardwired sense of rightness, and stealing something that's too much of a hassle to purchase legally feels okay to most people. I feel exactly the same way.</blockquote>

<p>I object to the use of the word "stealing", but he's right anyway.</p>
