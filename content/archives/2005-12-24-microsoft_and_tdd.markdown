<p>I wanted to take a look at <a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms182521.aspx">this MSDN article</a>, referenced <a href="http://www.artima.com/weblogs/viewpost.jsp?thread=137207">in a post by Michael Feathers</a> &#8212; only to see that it has been withdrawn. With an average rating of 1.36 of 9 by 523 people, this seems to have been a good idea &#8230; I guess the original author must feel really, really bad ;-)</p>
