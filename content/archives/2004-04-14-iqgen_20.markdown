<p>My company, <a href="/">innoQ</a>, has just released version 2 of its model driven software generator, <a href="/iqgen">iQgen</a>. I have mentioned the product a few times before; if you are considering to try out <a href="http://www.omg.org/mda">MDA</a> in a manner that leaves architectural choices to you, give it a try (it&#8217;s commercial, but free for personal and non-commercial use). </p>

<p>Expect some related posts within the next few weeks.</p>
