<p>Ted Leung <a href="http://www.sauria.com/blog/2003/10/20#636" title="Ted Leung on the air">writes about</a> ways to follow lots of blogs. Since my move to Linux, I have looked for a replacement for my beloved <a href="http://www.bradsoft.com/feeddemon/index.asp">FeedDemon</a>, and while <a href="http://www.nongnu.org/straw/">Straw</a> looked nice from the docs, I wasn't able to get it to run (it requires a whole bunch of other stuff, and while I actually gathered all of it, it just core-dumps on startup). So out of necessity, I looked for something else - and came up with <a href="http://www.bloglines.com">BlogLines</a> - a very easy to use, web-based RSS service. Running it in Mozilla FireBird, I can quicly scan each newsfeed in a single page, click on the articles I want to post about later to open them in a new tab, and then read one by one. Very nice, and with the advantage of being accesible from any of the machines I use.</p>
