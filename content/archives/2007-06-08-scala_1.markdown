<blockquote>
<p>Scala&#8217;s actors (and remote actors) implement a pretty good chunk of erlang-like processes, process management, and message passing. And the performance on an unmodified jvm is beyond impressive. I guess it makes sense since event-oriented java library implementations have done the same. Scala takes that somewhat clumsy approach (in java) and wraps it up in a much nicer language and a richer erlang-like library.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m not ready to move away from <a href="http://www.ruby-lang.org">my current favorite programming language</a> anytime soon, but if I were, <a href="http://www.scala-lang.org/index.html">Scala</a> would be a good candidate.</p>
