<p><a href="http://www.markbaker.ca/2002/09/Blog/2006/02/28#deliciousdistobj.A_format_replac...tack_">Via Mark Baker</a>, I stumbled across these <a href="http://www.scripting.com/2006/02/28.html#When:9:37:51AM">two</a> <a href="http://www.scripting.com/2006/02/28.html#When:10:24:50AM">idiotic</a> posts &#8212; reminding me how much better my blog-reading experience has got since I unsubscribed from Dave Winer&#8217;s feed. What about you? Did you replace J2EE by RSS yet?</p>

<p>Actually, I think there&#8217;s something to those comments, as the comparison is actually <em>HTTP</em>+RSS vs J2EE (HTTP is assumed).  But that comparison is more apropos, no?</p>

<p>You know I&#8217;d be happy to agree that it might make more sense to standardize on protocols, formats, and interface(s) than on a technology stack. But claiming one can &#8220;replace J2EE with RSS&#8221; is just so &#8230; totally ignorant.</p>
