<p>I&#8217;m happy to announce that we have finalized <a href="https://www.soa-expertenwissen.de/">the web site</a> for our (German) SOA book, which should be available now in <a href="http://www.amazon.de/SOA-Expertenwissen-Methoden-Konzepte-serviceorientierter-Architekturen/dp/3898644375/ref=sr_1_1/303-0721540-2567429?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1173426916&amp;sr=8-1">an online store near you</a>. I should point out that I only authored a single chapter on my own (about REST, of course), co-authored three others together with <a href="http://www.gernotstarke.de/">Gernot Starke</a>, but apart from that &#8212; also together with Gernot &#8212; <em>only</em> took care of collecting, selecting, and reviewing the contributions from an impressive list of authors, virtually all of them very well-known in the German speaking countries.</p>

<p>You can download <a href="https://www.soa-expertenwissen.de/buch/vorwort">the preface</a> &#8212; written by the great <a href="http://www.bowlight.net/">Anne Thomas Manes</a> &#8212;, <a href="https://www.soa-expertenwissen.de/buch/einleitung">the introduction</a> and the <a href="http://www.soa-expertenwissen.de/kapitel/grundlagen">basics chapter</a> (both written by Gernot and me), as well as check out information about <a href="https://www.soa-expertenwissen.de/autoren">the authors</a>,  among them my innoQ colleagues <a href="http://www.bandholtz.eu/index_en">Thomas Bandholtz</a> (who authored a chapter about SOA and Semantics), <a href="/blog/pg">Phillip Ghadir</a> (who wrote about REST and unexpected service consumers), <a href="https://www.soa-expertenwissen.de/autoren#Roth">Roman Roth</a> (value-add oriented service design), and <a href="/blog/hw/">Hartmut Wilms</a> (Microsoft WCF). You can also watch the <a href="https://www.soa-expertenwissen.de/blog">site&#8217;s blog planet</a> for news postings.</p>

<p>The web site, BTW, was designed by <a href="http://www.dirkhesse.com/english/">Dirk Hesse</a>, whose ability to improve by taking away continues to amaze me.</p>
