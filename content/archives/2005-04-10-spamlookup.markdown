<p>I&#8217;ve installed <a href="http://bradchoate.com/projects/spamlookup/">SpamLookup</a> as an MT-Blacklist alternative &#8212; so far, this looks <em>very</em> promising. (The CAPTCHA I have now for protecting against comment spam sucks, but works; so I&#8217;m interested in SpamLookup mostly for preventing TrackBack spam.)</p>

<p>i&#8217;d be interested in hearing how you got spamlookup to work once installed.  i&#8217;m having a difficult time of it  - but then i&#8217;m on a windows server running apache 2.x.  hope to hear from you </p>

<p>regards,</p>

<p>Ryan, I basically only followed the installation instructions, and luckily did not run into any problems (our server platform is Linux, though). So I (un)fortunately have zero knowledge about how to debug an installation &#8230;</p>
