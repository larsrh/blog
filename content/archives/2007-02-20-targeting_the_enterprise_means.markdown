<p>Once I have some time I need to do a simple app that reads Pete Lacey&#8217;s feed and simply posts a new item here <a href="http://wanderingbarque.com/nonintersecting/2007/02/20/web-of-services-position-paper/">every time he writes something</a>. Should be doable with a few lines of code, and would be a nice demo of Atom/APP features &#8230;</p>

<p>Anyway, check out his submission to the <a href="http://www.infoq.com/news/2007/01/w3c-ws-workshop">W3C workshop</a>: <a href="http://www.w3.org/2007/01/wos-papers/lacey">Targeting the Enterprise Means Ignoring the World</a>.</p>
