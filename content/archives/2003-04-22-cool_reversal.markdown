<p>In an <a href="http://www.webservices.org/index.php/article/view/993/">article at webservices.org</a>, I found this truly funny explanation about BEA's history:<br />
</p><blockquote>The company's initial product line, Tuxedo, purchased from Novell in 1996, is a transaction monitor - essentially, an application server without the Web UI features.</blockquote><br />
This is so great - it's like saying "C++ is a sort of compiled Java".
