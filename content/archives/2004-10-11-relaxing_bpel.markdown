<p><a href="http://blogs.fivesight.com/pbblog/">Paul R. Brown</a> has put together an <a href="http://blogs.fivesight.com/pbblog/index.php?p=39">RNC Schema for BPEL</a> &#8212; mostly because he wanted to use Emacs and <a href="http://www.xmlhack.com/read.php?item=2061">nxml-mode</a> to author BEPL scripts. I wonder: Has this maybe been <a href="http://www.jclark.com/bio.htm">James Clark</a>&#8217;s hidden agenda when building nxml-mode in the first place? Just to give people another good reason to use RELAX NG instead of XML Schema? :-)</p>
