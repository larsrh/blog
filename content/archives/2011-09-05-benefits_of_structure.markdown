<p>Whether it&#8217;s some project-internal documentation, a public presentation, training material or any other kind of technical content, I find it amazing how often the very simplest advice could help the authors improve their work dramatically: Add some structure.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve just seen yet another document where the authors describe their outline in the introduction, and then proceed to ignore it; where random bits of information are inserted in the middle of a section they clearly don&#8217;t belong to; where a topic is picked up, dropped, picked up again, and finally left hanging in some state of limbo. </p>

<p>I find that structuring your thoughts is the very first thing you should do when you create content for others to consume. If you don&#8217;t do this before you start writing, at the very least have the courtesy to do it before you hand it over to anybody else to look at. I find this just as obvious as making sure there are no spelling errors. Apart from making it a lot easier to make others understand what you were thinking, it helps you think in the first place.</p>
