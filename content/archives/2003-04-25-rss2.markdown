<p>Thanks to a pointer by <a href="http://www.superluminal.com/dave/weblog/archives/000344.html" title="Settling in">Dave Seidel</a>, I now have an <a href="/blog/st/index-rss2.xml">RSS2 feed</a>. I simply added a new template to MT and pasted <a href="http://diveintomark.org/public/rss2.tmpl">Mark Pilgrim's RSS2 template for MT</a> into it. Works perfectly!<br />
Although I'm probably the only one using it right now ... seems like a sort of masturbation to subscribe to your own newsfeed, but what the heck - perhaps I'll someday be surprised by the new items I post myself ;-)</p>
