Being a programming language geek, I typically try to use the
Christmas vacation to learn (or rather, play with) a programming
language I don't know. This year, I find this very hard, as there are
so many interesting languages one could spend time with. Some I have
considered are:

* Go: I was thoroughly unimpressed with this language when it came
  out, and I still fail to see a lot of interesting stuff in it. But
  I've heard many people I respect say only good things about their
  experience with it, so maybe I should reconsider.
* Rust: At first glance, this seems to be a very nicely designed
  language (and it has a really excellent tutorial). Even though its
  language features are very advanced, it seems to be intended for
  low-level use cases (that I mostly don't have).
* Fantom: Seems to be  interesting, too; I remember I looked at it
  a long time ago, but never in depth.

What do you think? What else is worth a look?
