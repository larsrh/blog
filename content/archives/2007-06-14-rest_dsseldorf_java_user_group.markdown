<p>I did my REST presentation once again; with a smart audience such as today&#8217;s this is always fun. It was also nice to meet <a href="http://plasmasturm.org/about/">Aristotle Pagaltzis</a> in person; luckily he was late and thus unable to point out all of my errors :-)</p>

<p>The slides (in German) are (still) <a href="/blog/st/presentations/2007/REST_-_das_bessere_Web-Service-Modell__Stefan_Tilkov.pdf">here</a>.</p>
