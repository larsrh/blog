<p>Stefan:</p>

<p>I watched this presentation and felt a bit disappointed. Granted that it was kind of short and this is the first time I saw Roy. I felt that his attempt to bring &#8220;peer-to-peer&#8221; in the web architecture via &#8220;relaxation&#8221; was a bit too relax. </p>

<p>He could have admitted that he blew it. He did not see peer-to-peer coming and it had designed an architecture style that had browsers and web servers in mind.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s easy to criticize IBM or Microsoft for the &#8220;null&#8221; architecture style of SOA or the &#8220;clunkyness&#8221; of SOAP and the like, but IMHO the debate is long closed. Both styles are useful, and people should focus on when to use them best. Representational State Transfer is a profound concept and as he pointed out there are probably few that use it correctly (not me) to represent application state.</p>

<p>The only point I found worthwhile was his point about &#8220;services&#8221; being what ever you want. He said in the REST architecture style, resources are well defined by their interface (URI + verbs), but services&#8230; My first response that it is easier to define a &#8220;thing&#8221; versus something that &#8220;does something&#8221;. But this is an interesting challenge.</p>
