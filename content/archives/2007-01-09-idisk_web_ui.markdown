<p>For once, I disagree with <a href="http://idisk.mac.com/yourusername">John Gruber</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>What&#8217;s sick is that performance using the Finder is still so poor &#8212; there&#8217;s something inherently wrong that a web UI for iDisk is faster than using the Finder.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s not sick at all, but blindingly obvious &#8212; if all your data is way <em>over there</em>, there&#8217;s no sense at all in having the logic <em>here</em>.</p>
