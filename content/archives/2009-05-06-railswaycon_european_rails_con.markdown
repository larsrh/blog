<p>As a member of its advisory board, I&#8217;m pretty proud of the lineup at <a href="http://it-republik.de/conferences/railswaycon/">RailsWayCon Berlin on May 25-27</a> - the speaker list includes Michael (Koz) Koziarski, Yehuda Katz, Ola Bini, Neal Ford, Steven Bristol, Jens-Christian Fischer, Jonathan Weiss, Mathias Meyer, Jan Krutisch, Steven Bristol, Maik Schmidt, Heiko Webers … I&#8217;ll be speaking about (you guess it) RESTful Rails; my colleague Vladimir Dobriakov will talk about the dark side of metaprogramming. I&#8217;m really looking forward to it. I think the fees are quite reasonable, specifically given that there are <a href="https://www.entwickler.com/ssl/formtool/index.php?id=18&amp;lang=en">special price tags</a> for freelancers and students (€ 399 and € 199 for the two-day pass, respectively; the standard fee is € 699).</p>

<p>In other words: If you haven&#8217;t considered attending yet, you must have a very good reason :-)</p>
