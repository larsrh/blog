<p>A great <a href="http://daringfireball.net/2004/04/spray_on_usability">rant by the Daring Fireball</a> on UI design and usability:
</p><blockquote>
UI development is the hard part. And it&#8217;s not the last step, it&#8217;s the first step. In my estimation, the difference between:

<ul>
<li>software that performs function X; and</li>
<li>software that performs function X, with an intuitive well-designed user interface</li>
</ul>

<p>isn&#8217;t just a little bit of extra work. It&#8217;s not even twice the work. It&#8217;s an entire order of magnitude more work. Developing software with a good UI requires both aptitude and a lot of hard work.
</p></blockquote>
Amen to that.
