<p>Now here&#8217;s a nice idea: <a href="http://rover.cs.northwestern.edu/~surana/blog/past/000137.html" title="Green Hat Journal: Project Plans">Create a future market</a> where people can bet on a project&#8217;s future. If the project is large enough so that people can&#8217;t influence the outcome just to win their bets, this would seem like a nice experiment &#8230;</p>
