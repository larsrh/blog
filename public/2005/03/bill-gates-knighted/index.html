	  <p>Everybody will have seen <a href="http://www.reuters.com/newsArticle.jhtml?type=topNews&#38;storyID=7774352">this news item</a>, reporting that Bill Gates will be knighted. Now, I have long ago stopped being religious about technical issues, I totally acknowledge that Gates is a business genius, and I admire his contributions to charitable causes. </p>

<p>But I&#8217;m utterly puzzled at what his &#8220;outstanding contribution to enterprise&#8221; might be. What concept or technology did he invent or further that wouldn&#8217;t have taken off without him? </p>

<p>That&#8217;s an honest question, BTW, I&#8217;m really keen to find out what people think about this.</p>
