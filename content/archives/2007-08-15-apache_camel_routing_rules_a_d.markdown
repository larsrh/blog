<p>Fascinating discussion on <a href="http://lambda-the-ultimate.org/node/2379">Lambda the Ultimate</a>, inspired by <a href="http://activemq.apache.org/camel/">Camel</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>[W]here is the boundary between an API and an embedded DSL? Is it in the eye of beholder or are there some objective differences?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>My view is that it&#8217;s definitely a question of taste and perception &#8212; if you look at the code, do you actually &#8220;see&#8221; a language API being used, or a different (if similar) language?</p>
