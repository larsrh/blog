<p><a href="http://www.infoworld.com/article/03/12/31/01OPstrategic_1.html">Jon Udell</a> suggests that the <em>true</em> synthesis of the Unix pipe model and the richness of GUIs lies in using XML instead of simple text input/output. I believe this is a very interesting idea, although clearly, just replacing tool-specific text output with XML output that is just as tool-specific will not buy you a lot. You would be able to use an XML editor, just as you can use a text editor to look at the output of a <em>grep</em> command; this will not make dealing with complicated outputs easier &mdash; after all, XML only streamlines syntax, not semantics.
I&#8217;m not really sure I see the solution in XUL or XAML. Both use XML, true &mdash; but that doesn&#8217;t mean they make dealing with XML data easier (they might, but I don&#8217;t see how they would be more suited to this just because they use XML to specifiy UI layout; these are orthogonal concepts). Maybe the semantic web/RDF vision is not so academic, after all &#8230;</p>
