<p><a href="http://blog.neontology.com/posts/2007/08/11/whats-nu">Tim Burks</a>, author of <a href="http://www.rubyobjc.com/">RubyObjC</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><a href="http://blog.neontology.com/posts/2007/08/11/whats-nu">Nu</a> [&#8230;] is the name I chose for a project that relates a different C to a different lambda. Nu is a new programming language that binds the expressive power of Lisp to the pervasiveness and machine-level efficiency of C by building on the power and flexibility of Objective-C.</p>
