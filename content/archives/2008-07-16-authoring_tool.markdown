<p>I'm looking for an authoring tool (for a book project - don't ask for more details just yet). It needs to work on a Mac.</p>

<p>The end goal is to create a Word document that makes use of styles only. No manual formatting, font changing etc. </p>

<p>Surely Word itself (and similar monstrosities, such as OpenOffice) can't be the only option?</p>

<p>I took a look at <a href="http://www.literatureandlatte.com/scrivener.html">Scrivener</a>, which seems nice, but exports really bad Word docs. I would love to use <a href="http://www.apple.com/iwork/pages/">Pages</a>, but it doesn't do outlines (WTF?). <a href="http://fletcherpenney.net/MultiMarkdown">MultiMarkdown</a> sounds perfect, but doesn't export to (real) Word docs. <a href="http://www.redlers.com/index.html">Mellel</a> seems nice, too - but again, the Word export just creates formatted text (no styles).</p>

<p><a href="http://www.43folders.com/people/yesno">John Bergmayer</a>'s <a href="http://www.43folders.com/2008/01/06/nyt-magazine-covers-scrivener-other-os-x-writing-apps#comment-336555">comment on 43folders</a> sums up my requirements perfectly:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The dream program for me would be a standard word processor, but one that REQUIRES the use of styles for all text. No free-form. No manually applying and formatting, ever. Add a mode for easier drafting/rearranging/outlining and good full-screen, and I’d be very happy.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I agree&#8230; I haven&#8217;t found anything that comes close. XXE (a docbook editor: <a href="http://www.xmlmind.com/xmleditor/)" rel="nofollow">http://www.xmlmind.com/xmleditor/)</a> with the FO Converter (http://www.xmlmind.com/foconverter/) might work, although I haven&#8217;t tried that combination personally</p>

<p>Hey Stefan,</p>

<p>have you thought about Docbook yet? We use XmlMind XmlEditor for &#8220;almost WYSIWYG&#8221; editing using the Docbook structuring elements. There are a lot of XSLT stylesheets available to transform it into Word, PDF or the like.</p>

<p>Regards, Ollie </p>

<p>I&#8217;ve used Docbook before, together with Emacs and nXML – but there the goal was to explicitly create multiple output formats. Considering an XML editor is probably a good idea, but I still need to generate the &#8220;styled&#8221; Word output. I&#8217;m not aware of a DocBook converter that does this.</p>

<p>You could probably simply convert your DocBook to very trivial WordML, no? If you only want to use styles and do not have any inline formatting, that shouldn&#8217;t be so difficult.</p>

<p>Apart from that, I think there is a DocBook -> WordML converter.</p>

<p>For the writing process I very much like scrivener, but you&#8217;re right - the word-output could be &#8220;optimized&#8221;.
Last time I endes up writing in scrivener with a few extra tags (yes, old fashioned, I know) and a couple of macros in word to convert the output according to the publishers guidelines.</p>

<p>Cheers

<p>Have you checked out LyX yet?</p>

<blockquote>&#8220;LyX combines the power and flexibility of TeX/LaTeX with the ease of use of a graphical interface.&#8221; (www.lyx.org)</blockquote>

<p>Very nice to work with, produces superb results. No word export, though.</p>

<p>I am not sure if there is a &#8216;good&#8217; Word export but <i>Ulysses</i> from <i>The Bluet Technologies Group</i> is maybe worth a try.</p>

<p>If I recall correctly you can set Word Styles based on tags but I am not quite sure.</p>

<p>A tryout is available. URL is <a href="http://www.blue-tec.com/products/" rel="nofollow" /><a href="http://www.blue-tec.com/products/" rel="nofollow">http://www.blue-tec.com/products/</a></p>

<p>I&#8217;ve checked out Word&#8217;s XML format, and actually the commenters are right –- it&#8217;s trivial to create a Word document in this format. </p>

<p>So I&#8217;m going with Scrivener for now, with the idea of exporting to plain text or Markdown, and then finally applying a little scripting and XSLT to produce WordML. Thanks for your input.</p>

<p>Hi Stefan, please publish your process and XSLT when you&#8217;re done, I think it might get popular. 8-)</p>
