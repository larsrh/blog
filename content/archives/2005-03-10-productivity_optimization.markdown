<p><a href="http://fishbowl.pastiche.org/2005/03/11/catching_a_silver_bullet">Charles Miller</a> catches a silver bullet. I agree one hundred percent: No single technology is going to make you 10 times more productive, not even <a href="http://www.rubyonrails.org/">Rails</a> (no matter how <a href="http://www.loudthinking.com/arc/000419.html">beautiful</a> it is). Still, I really, really like Ruby and Rails &#8212; I hope to find some time to play with it in earnest soon.</p>
