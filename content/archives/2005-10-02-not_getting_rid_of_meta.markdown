<p>It&#8217;s taken me ages, relatively speaking, to link to <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/stevecook/archive/2005/09/22/472742.aspx">Steve Cook&#8217;s post on getting rid of meta</a>. In the meantime, though, he&#8217;s written my comment for me:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A metamodel specifies the concepts of the language in which the model is defined. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>That seems to be about as clear as it gets, as opposed to this:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>[&#8230;] we decided to call the models of the concepts in our DSLs Domain Models; which contain Domain Classes, Domain Relationships, Domain Properties, Domain Roles and so on.&#160; These models are used to generate tools, and serialized in files.&#160; We also have a model which we use to generate the tool and formats that we use to manipulate Domain Models &#8211; we call this the Domain Model Domain Model, or DMDM</p>
</blockquote>
