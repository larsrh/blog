<p><a href="http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2003/04/23/DieNumber4" title="Speaking of Browsers... Hooray!">Tim Bray is happy</a> that his company has finally made the decision to drop support for 4.x browsers in theit Web UI. I think this is a very good idea, and I plan to advocate that decision for future products and projects <a href="/">of our own</a>. </p>

<p>How very sad that the browser that once was the leading edge implementation is to blame for having to think about this at all. Had Netscape/AOL come up with a decent 5.x version of their browser, a lot of people would have a lot less work now ...</p>
