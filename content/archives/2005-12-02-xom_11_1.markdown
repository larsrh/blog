<p><a href="http://www.cafeconleche.org/#news2005December1">ERH has released XOM 1.1</a>: </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Version 1.1 maintains backwards compatibility with XOM 1.0 while adding a number of important new features including XPath queries, document subset canonicalization, exclusive XML canonicalization, external XSLT parameters, and xml:id support. It also fixes a number of bugs that were present in XOM 1.0, uses less memory, and is two to four times faster for many common operations.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In case you don&#8217;t know XOM, it&#8217;s an XML API alternative to JDOM or dom4j and very much worth a closer look.</p>
