<p>Found via <a href="http://www.markbaker.ca/2002/09/Blog/2003/08/08#2003-08-vinoski-rest">Mark Baker</a>: A paper on <a href="http://www.iona.com/hyplan/vinoski/pdfs/IEEE-Web_Services_Interaction_Model_Part_2.pdf">Web Services Interaction Models</a> by Steve Vinosky. I remember religiously following Steve's and <a href="http://www.cs.wustl.edu/~schmidt/">Doug Schmidt</a>'s CORBA columns, and it's a nice reminder that these guys are still around ;-)</p>
