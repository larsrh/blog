	  <p><a href="http://www.snellspace.com/wp/?p=846">James Snell</a> points to a piece from <a href="http://www.symphonious.net/2008/01/08/atom-is-the-new-jcr/">Adrian Sutton</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>When the Java Content Repository (JCR) standard first came out it was supposed to bring in a new era of compatibility between content repositories and put an end to the content silo. There was, and still is, a lot of talk about it and just about everyone added JCR compliance to their marketing materials. Unfortunately, that&#8217;s mostly where things stopped - the implementation work that followed was generally done was buggy or incomplete and the only viable JCR implementations that I&#8217;ve seen have come out of Day Software, who lead the JCR spec effort.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#8217;ve always wondered why Roy Fielding, of all people, would say <a href="http://www.webpronews.com/topnews/2004/09/21/day-implements-content-repository-api-for-java-technology-jcr-to-the-apache-software-foundation">something like this</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I expect JCR to become the central interface between Java application development and future content management infrastructure, just as HTTP/1.1 has become the interface through which everyone uses the World Wide Web.</p>

<p>Artifactory, from jfrog folks, &#8230; &#8220;uses a JSR-170 compliant Java Content Repository (JCR) for storage, using the Apache Jackrabbit implementation.&#8221;  Works pretty well for us, given that we rely on maven as our build tool.</p>
