<p>BEA has put up product documentation for its <a href="http://www.bea.com/framework.jsp?CNT=overview.htm&amp;FP=/content/products/aqualogic/service_registry/">AquaLogic Service Registry</a> &#8212; which is in fact <a href="http://www.systinet.com/products/sr/overview">Systinet&#8217;s Service Registry</a>. (I don&#8217;t know how long it&#8217;s going to remain that way, but the screenshot in the middle of that page even has a Systinet logo.)</p>

<p>Congratulations to <a href="http://geeklandia.blogspot.com/">Roman</a>, <a href="http://radovanjanecek.net/blog">Rados</a> and the rest of the team on a really, really cool deal ;-)</p>

<p>Thank you! AquaLogic looks like consistent beyond-J2EE vision. Even better to be a part of it.</p>
