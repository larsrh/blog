Interestingly enough, Sean McGrath has a  <a href="http://seanmcgrath.blogspot.com/archives/2004_02_15_seanmcgrath_archive.html#107725548502456442">post</a> about an impedance mismatch, albeit on a higher level.
The more I think about it, the more I believe that the idea of using XML as a simple object serialization format for statically typed languages is fundamentally flawed, at least in the context of loosely-coupled, service oriented system architectures.</p>
