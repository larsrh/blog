<p>Reading <a href="http://www.25hoursaday.com/weblog/PermaLink.aspx?guid=6523c363-1572-46bd-8ded-abf206c06569">these</a> <a href="http://www.25hoursaday.com/weblog/PermaLink.aspx?guid=75f21b33-fae8-4817-8710-085b3eaec9b9">two</a> postings should give you enough reason to understand why <a href="http://www.25hoursaday.com/weblog/">this guy</a> is my favorite Microsoft employee. </p>

<p>I honestly believe that people like Dare do a lot more to make others appreciate Microsoft than those who appear <a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0001011/">brainwashed</a>.</p>

<p>You have not justified the label &#8220;brainwashed&#8221;. Can you be more specific?</p>

<p>Sure. First of all, let me point out that I like Scoble a lot (without knowing him personally) - the fact that he even linked to my post says a lot about him. </p>

<p>Still, I have severe trouble understanding how anyone could seriously propose a classical embrace and extend strategy like this</p>

<p><a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0001011/2003/12/15.html#a5764" rel="nofollow" /><a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0001011/2003/12/15.html#a5764" rel="nofollow">http://radio.weblogs.com/0001011/2003/12/15.html#a5764</a></p>

<p>and expect that anyone outside MS would ever agree to something like that.</p>

<p>You&#8217;ll never see Dare Obasanjo or Doug Purdy propose anything similar.</p>

<p>That post was a mistake. I got reamed for it widely, from both inside and outside the company. I&#8217;ve posted thousands of posts. Sometimes some of them are gonna be rotten. Sorry about that.</p>

<p>Robert, frankly I feel sorry for having picked you of all possible examples. My orginal post&#8217;s intention was not to insult you, but rather to express how highly I value Dare&#8217;s credibility.</p>

<p>No problem, it makes for good theater. Ever listen to a radio talk show where everyone agreed with each other? Boring, huh?</p>
