<p>WSO2 has WS-* bindings for <a href="http://dist.wso2.org/products/wsf/perl/1.0.0/">Perl</a> and has just started working on the <a href="http://wso2.org/wiki/display/wsfruby/WSF">Ruby</a> variant. Think of the WS-* universe what you want, but I believe this is good news for Ruby since it removes one reason not to use it in enterprisey contexts.</p>
