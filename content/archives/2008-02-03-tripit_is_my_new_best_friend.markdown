<p>If you travel and haven&#8217;t yet heard of TripIt, you&#8217;re going to be sooo excited! TripIt is a site that keeps track of your travel. But unlike many other sites that promise to help you with your travel, this one is so easy and useful, you&#8217;ll actually use it.<br /><br />Here&#8217;s what you do: when you get an itinerary from the airline or a hotel, just email it to plans@tripit.com. You&#8217;re done.</p>

<p>I found this really intriguing &#8212; this sounds like something that could actually be really useful. Sadly, it couldn&#8217;t handle any of the five test flight bookings I sent to it, somewhat unsurprising as they were coming from European airlines. But there are probably many more cool ideas one could build using an email interface.</p>

<p>Email interfaces are excellent, particularly because they function well on your PDA, etc. My expense tracking project (http://xpenser.com) takes it a couple of steps further, letting you interact with it with email, SMS, Twitter, IM, voice, and Web. I&#8217;m a huge believer in multi-modal interfaces.</p>

<p>Don&#8217;t despair &#8212; when I first started using TripIt, I sent them an itinerary for a WestJet flight (WestJet is a discount Canadian airline), and it wasn&#8217;t recognized. I went back in a couple of days later and it had reprocessed the itinerary and recognized it that time. In some cases, they just haven&#8217;t seen an example of the airline itinerary form, and you might be pleasantly surprised at how quickly they can add them. It also helps to send them a suggestion to add the airline, that can bring their attention to what&#8217;s missing.</p>

<p>TripIt is absolutely the best piece of web software that I&#8217;ve started using in the past year.</p>
