<blockquote>
<p>I think it is well established that HTTP Authentication needs a major kick in the ass and OpenID and OAuth may get us most of the way there. However, until I see RFC#&#8217;s attached to both I&#8217;m hardly going to consider them to be complete. I propose the creation of an IETF WG on Identity and Authentication. The WG would be chartered to produce two RFC&#8217;s covering each of the two areas. OpenID and OAuth could be used to seed the WG effort.</p>
