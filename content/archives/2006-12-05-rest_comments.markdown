<p>I hope it will not be too long until we have comment feeds at <a href="http://www.infoq.com">InfoQ</a>. I hate finding out I missed comments such as <a href="http://www.infoq.com/articles/mark-baker-REST#view_2912">this one</a> from <a href="http://stucharlton.com/blog/">Stuart Charlton</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Many in positions of power really do not like the web, for a variety of social, technical, and economic reasons. They may use web technologies used for cost avoidance &#38; productivity, but want their systems to be as fat-client-like as possible. Pushing web-style inside a corporation can at times be a career limiting move. I do not know if this is temporary or permanent; I will observe that power tends to endure until a major crisis.</p>
