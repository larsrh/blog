<p>I&#8217;ve been enjoying your blog for a long time and am glad to get links to other Ruby postings.  Lately I&#8217;ve been working on a DSL for metrics+monitoring, basically a wrapper around RRDTool.  I&#8217;ve blogged a little about it and hope to add more details as I progress in learning.  <a href="http://arosien.blogspot.com" rel="nofollow" /><a href="http://arosien.blogspot.com" rel="nofollow">http://arosien.blogspot.com</a></p>
