<p>Interesting to read this from <a href="http://blogs.osafoundation.org/mitch/000812.html">Mitch Kapor</a>, of all people, considering that it was his former company who created one of the best-known replication technologies:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The exception to the far greater convenience of the browser is off-line usage. With no net connection, data stored in a web app is inaccessible. So, infrastructure to support local storage of data (via caching, via something fancier) as a standard affordance of web-based applications is perhaps the biggest remaining barrier to be overcome. There is no fundamental reason I am aware of it can&#8217;t be overcome either on a case-by-case basis, or better, in a more general way which would work not just for a given application, but for many of them.</p>
