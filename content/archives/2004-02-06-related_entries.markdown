<p>You might have noticed that my weblog now display related entries for most of the posts. In case you are wondering why these sometimes don&#8217;t seem to make sense, the explanation is that they are generated automatically. (In case you&#8217;re interested how, <a href="http://kalsey.com/2003/05/related_entries_revisited/">here</a> is the recipe, which will only work for MT and MySQL). Basically, every time I rebuild, a full text search is performed, using the posting&#8217;s title and keywords as the search terms. </p>

<p>I&#8217;m not really sure whether this is something I want to keep or not. Sometimes it works so well that <a href="http://www.dehora.net/journal/archives/000360.html">people actually take them for having been created manually</a> . Sometimes they don&#8217;t seem to make sense at all.</p>

<p>I think having related links displayed is very useful, but I&#8217;d much rather avoid having to provide the necessary metadata myself.</p>
