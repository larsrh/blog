<p><a href="http://wiki.apache.org/incubator/SynapseProposal">Synapse</a> is an Apache Incubator project that aims to create an Open Source ESB. (I came across this via <a href="http://schneider.blogspot.com/archives/2005_08_14_schneider_archive.html#112457280823341618">Jeff Schneider</a>, who open-sources his orchestration IDE and engine as well as his transformation stuff to add something to the mix.) </p>

<p>With the JBI-based alternatives <a href="http://servicemix.org/">ServiceMix</a> and <a href="http://servicemix.org/">Celtix</a>, there&#8217;s going to be at least three OS ESBs to choose from (strangely, with IONA involved in two of them). And I wonder whether the world even needs one &#8230; ;-)</p>
