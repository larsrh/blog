<p><a href="http://www-106.ibm.com/developerworks/webservices/library/specification/ws-rm/">WS-ReliableMessaging</a> has been <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/press/2005/apr05/04-19OasisStandardizationPR.asp">turned over</a> to OASIS &#8212; great news. Hopefully consolidation with <a href="http://docs.oasis-open.org/wsrm/2004/06/WS-Reliability-CD1.086.pdf">WS-Reliability</a> is not too far away.</p>
