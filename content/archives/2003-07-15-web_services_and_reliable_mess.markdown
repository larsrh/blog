<blockquote>So, given the well worn nature of the path I am on, how come that here in 2003 we have HTTPR[4], WS-Reliability[5], WS-ReliableMessaging[6], EBMS[7] and a host of other mutually repugnant 'standards' for solving the well understood problem of reliable messaging?</blockquote>
<p>Very true. I think that <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/dnglobspec/html/ws-reliablemessaging.asp">WS-ReliableMessaging</a> is clearly going to win; sadly, this is not because of technical merit, but simply because of who designed the spec. If only the big guys could stop this and get together ... well, enough dreaming for tonight.</p>
