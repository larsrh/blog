<p>More and more people are buying and loving Macs. To make this choice simply irresistible, Apple will include technology in the next major release of Mac OS X, Leopard, that lets you install and run the Windows XP operating system on your Mac. Called Boot Camp (for now), you can download a public beta today.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/bootcamp/">WTF</a>? Who would have thought it possible that Apple would release dual-boot capability (instead of virtualization)?</p>

<p>The quotes are priceless:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>EFI and BIOS</em><br />
Macs use an ultra-modern industry standard technology called EFI to handle booting. Sadly, Windows XP, and even the upcoming Vista, are stuck in the 1980s with old-fashioned BIOS. But with Boot Camp, the Mac can operate smoothly in both centuries.</p>

<p><em>Word to the Wise</em><br />
Windows running on a Mac is like Windows running on a PC. That means it&#8217;ll be subject to the same attacks that plague the Windows world. So be sure to keep it updated with the latest Microsoft Windows security fixes.</p>
