<p>Yesterday I gave a talk at <a href="http://www.soa-forum.de/">SOA-Forum</a>, a German conference, on the topic of SOA and MDA (or MDE, as I&#8217;m starting to call the generic concept). I think my presentation was a little too theoretical for the audience, but I&#8217;m putting up <a href="/blog/st/presentations/2005/SOA-MDE.pdf">the slides</a> &#8212; as usual probably not very useful without the accompanying talk &#8212; anyway.

<p>Sounds interesting (though the link to the slides does not work). I have just started up a Working Group in OMG to consolidate best practice for applying modeling to SOA and drive new drive new/updated standards (e.g. metamodels/profiles) to achieve better interoperability between tools. Initially we&#8217;re in &#8216;information seeking&#8217; mode - see <a href="http://www.omg.org/news/meetings/tc/agendas/SOA.pdf" rel="nofollow" /><a href="http://www.omg.org/news/meetings/tc/agendas/SOA.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.omg.org/news/meetings/tc/agendas/SOA.pdf</a> - and are keen to hear what people are doing today. One thing we will aim to do is establish a &#8216;resources page&#8217; pulling together what&#8217;s already out there.</p>
