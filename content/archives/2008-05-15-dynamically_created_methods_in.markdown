<p><a href="http://ola-bini.blogspot.com/2008/05/dynamically-created-methods-in-ruby.html">Ola Bini</a> on when to use <code>def</code>, <code>define_method</code>, inside our outside of <code>eval</code>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Defining methods can be complicated in Ruby, and you absolutely need to know when to use which one of these variations. Try to avoid define_method unless you absolutely have to, and remember that def is available in more places than you might think.</p>
