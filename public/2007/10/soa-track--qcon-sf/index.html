	  <p>I&#8217;m very much looking forward to <a href="http://qcon.infoq.com/sanfrancisco/tracks/show_track.jsp?trackOID=69">the SOA track</a> at <a href="http://qcon.infoq.com/sanfrancisco/conference/">QCon</a>, the conferences organized by <a href="http://jaoo.dk/">JAOO</a> and <a href="http://www.infoq.com/">InfoQ</a>, which takes place in San Francisco in November. I am &#8220;hosting&#8221; the track, which essentially means that I picked the topic, invited the speakers, and will talk for 15 minutes in exchange for being able to have a lot of fun in San Francisco :-)</p>

<p>We have been able to get an exceptionally great list of speakers for the SOA track (the topic is &#8220;<a href="http://qcon.infoq.com/sanfrancisco/presentation/Introduction%3A+Connecting+SOA+and+the+Web%3A+How+much+REST+do+we+need">Connecting SOA and the Web: How much REST do we need?</a>&#8221;):</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://steve.vinoski.net/blog/">Steve Vinoski</a>, former CORBA Guru #1 at IONA, will introduce the REST concept for those familiar with SOA (&#8220;<a href="http://qcon.infoq.com/sanfrancisco/presentation/REST+Eye+for+the+SOA+Guy">REST Eye for the SOA Guy</a>&#8221;). See his <a href="http://steve.vinoski.net/blog/2007/09/26/qcon-soa-track/">blog entry</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.bloglines.com/blog/sanjiva">Sanjiva Weerawarana</a>, CEO of WSO2, will explain what he considers the real truth behind the WS-* vs. REST discussion (&#8220;WS-* vs. REST: Mashing up the Truth from Facts, Myths and Lies&#8221;) </li>
<li>Burton Group analyst <a href="http://wanderingbarque.com/nonintersecting/">Pete Lacey</a> will counter Sanjiva&#8217;s talk by showing how REST is suitable for big bad enterprise scenarios (&#8220;<a href="http://qcon.infoq.com/sanfrancisco/presentation/Code+Talks%3A+Demonstrating+the+%22ilities%22+of+REST">Code Talks: Demonstrating the &#8216;ilities&#8217; of REST</a>&#8221;)</li>
<li>XFire and CXF developer <a href="http://netzooid.com/blog/">Dan Diephouse</a> will explain how to use AtomPub to build services (&#8220;<a href="http://qcon.infoq.com/sanfrancisco/presentation/Building+your+next+service+with+the+Atom+Publishing+Protocol">Building your next service with the Atom Publishing Protocol</a>&#8221;)</li>
<li>Finally, <a href="http://jim.webber.name/">Jim Webber</a> will elaborate on his approach to Web services, which according to him is remarkably similar to REST done right (&#8220;<a href="http://qcon.infoq.com/sanfrancisco/presentation/A+couple+of+ways+to+skin+an+Internet-scale+cat">A couple of ways to skin an Internet-scale cat</a>&#8221;). I can also heartily recommend his <a href="http://qcon.infoq.com/sanfrancisco/presentation/Guerrilla+SOA">Guerilla SOA talk</a> &#8212; the version of it he gave at <a href="/blog/st/2007/03/15/qcon_london_soa_track_report.html">QCon London</a> is among my all-time favorite presentations. Jim has got <a href="http://jim.webber.name/2007/10/16/87153148-7a84-4363-8c19-6bce6cd4054b.aspx">a blog entry about QCon</a>, too.</li>
</ul>

<p>As you will probably notice if you&#8217;re a regular visitor here, I&#8217;ve somehow managed to assemble my personal speaker &#8220;dream team&#8221; :-)</p>

<p>Check out <a href="http://qcon.infoq.com/sanfrancisco/schedule/wednesday.jsp">the complete schedule</a> &#8212; there are lots of other impressive <a href="http://qcon.infoq.com/sanfrancisco/tracks/">tracks</a> and <a href="http://qcon.infoq.com/sanfrancisco/speakers/">speakers</a>, too.</p>

<p>I hear that <a href="https://secure.trifork.com/sanfrancisco/registration/">registration</a> is still possible &#8230;</p>
