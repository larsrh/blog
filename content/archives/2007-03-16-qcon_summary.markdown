<p>I&#8217;m on my way home, sitting in some bar at Heathrow airport. I think it was a great conference, and judging from the feedback I gathered, most people agreed. (If you didn&#8217;t and happen to read this, I&#8217;d be very interested to see why). Personaly, I had a great time &#8212; I had so many interesting conversations, some of them with people I&#8217;ve known on the Net for years and only now met in person, as well as with people I just got to know there, that this alone would have been worth attending. </p>

<p>Two rules I need to remember for QCon 2008:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Do not mention MDA around Martin Fowler. It makes him leave the party very early.</p></li>
<li><p>Do not get into a discussion about programming language theory with Eric Meijer, Patrick Linskey, and Cedric Beust. Especially not at 2:30 AM after way too many alcoholic beverages ;-)</p></li>
</ol>
