<p>O <a href="http://www.lazyweb.org/" title="LazyWeb">LazyWeb</a>, please share thy knowledge with me: Although doing this myself would likely be fun, somebody else will have done it, and better than I could &mdash; Amazon keeps a list of one's purchases, and displaying them in the weblog would be kind of cool. Is there something like this already?</p>

<p>Thanks; I new about MTAmazon, but couldn&#8217;t see any obvious way to use it for my purposes. I&#8217;ll give it a closer look.</p>
