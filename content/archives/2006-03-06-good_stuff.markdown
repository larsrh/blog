<p>Two observations for today: </p>

<ol>
<li><a href="http://www.cabochon.com/~stevey/blog-rants/">Steve Yegge&#8217;s stuff</a> rocks. While you might not agree with everything, every single post of his is worth reading.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.jwz.org/doc/java.html">JWZ&#8217;s Java rant</a>, which I last read and dismissed maybe 5 or 6 years ago, still makes a lot of sense to me (probably a lot more now, since I understand many more of concepts from other languages he mentions).</li>
</ol>
