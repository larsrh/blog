<p>I had a great time at JAOO - at what other conference do you get a chance to talk to (and in many occasions, have a beer with) <a href="http://www.davethomas.net/">Dave Thomas</a>, <a href="http://www.martinfowler.com/">Martin Fowler</a>, <a href="http://www.ivarjacobson.com/postnuke/html/">Ivar Jacobson</a>, <a href="http://www.research.microsoft.com/%7Eemeijer/">Eric Meyer</a>, <a href="http://dynamicsemantics.blog-city.com/">Floyd Marinescu</a>, and <a href="http://blogs.thinktecture.com/cweyer/">Christian Weyer</a>, all in one day? </p>

<p>I&#8217;ve uploaded <a href="/blog/st/presentations/2005/MDA/Multi-Paradigm-Modeling.pdf">the slides</a> for my talk; I hope JAOO&#8217;s organizers will merge the MDA and DSL tracks next year, since the topic is really not that different. But more on that at another time &#8230;</p>

<p>The &#8220;slides&#8221; link seems to be wrong?!
