<p>Unfortunately, the current <a href="http://www.intellij.com/eap">IntelliJ EAP build</a> (977) does not work on Panther. At least this <a href="http://www.intellij.net/forums/thread.jsp?forum=22&amp;thread=54360&amp;tstart=0&amp;trange=15" title="Forums - Buld 977 on OS X">thread</a> in the IntelliJ forum explains that they are working on it, and might even provide a version that looks like a &#8220;real&#8221; OS X app soon. Sigh &#8230;</p>
