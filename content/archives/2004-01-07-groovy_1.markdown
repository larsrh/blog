<p>If you don&#8217;t already know it, the <a href="http://groovy.codehaus.org">Groovy</a> language, currently still in its infancy and developed by <a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0112098/">James Strachan</a>, is definitely worth a look. I linked to it <a href="/blog/st/archives/000389.html">before</a>, but after having built and played with the version from CVS, I&#8217;m absolutely hooked.</p>
