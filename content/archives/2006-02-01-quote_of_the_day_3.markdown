<blockquote>
<p>But let&#8217;s get serious - Dell isn&#8217;t going to be running its order management system from some Web 2.0 SaaS startup - nor will e-Trade be hosting customer financial data in some &#8220;non-enterprise&#8221; way. People who don&#8217;t do enterprise development don&#8217;t understand enterprise development; there are a million blogs out there to prove this. An enterprise can lose more money in one day because of a system outage than the combined revenue of every SaaS / Web 2.0 company combined. </p>
