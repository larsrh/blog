<p><a href="http://incubator.apache.org/servicemix/beanflow.html">BeanFlow</a>, as described by <a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0112098/2006/05/24.html#a563">James Strachan</a>, seems like a good idea. I questioned the value of orchestration engines <a href="/blog/st/2005/02/28/declarative_process_definitions.html">a while back</a>; one of the most interesting comments was from <a href="http://mult.ifario.us/articles/2005/02/28/its-a-slippery-slope-from-merge-to-orchestation">Paul R Brown</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>BPEL exists because Java, Python, Jython, and Ruby &#8212; as well as more interesting and exotic stuff like Join Java and TyCO &#8212; simply don&#8217;t support those three core aspects of the merge scenario, and doing a good implementation from scratch is complex.</p>
