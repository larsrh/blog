<p>There&#8217;s <a href="http://www.infoq.com/interviews/Stefan-Tilkov-SOA">an interview with Yours Truly</a> (on SOA) up at InfoQ. <a href="http://dynamicsemantics.blog-city.com/">Floyd</a> did this with me long before InfoQ launched, back at JAOO 2005; looking at the transcript, the fact that my views have changed only slightly since then is surprising ;-)</p>

<p>Very good, very undogmatic and down-to-earth. And to finally getting a voice to the blog is especially nice, too.</p>
