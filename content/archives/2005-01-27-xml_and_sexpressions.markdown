<p><a href="http://www.windley.com/archives/2005/01/xml_and_scheme.shtml">Phil Windley</a> provides <a href="http://classes.eclab.byu.edu/330/wiki/index.cgi?XMLandScheme">a simple and smart explanation</a> about what&#8217;s fundamentally cool about Lisp, Scheme and its relatives. I wonder how long it will take before the idea to treat data as code, and code as data, will finally become universally accepted.</p>
