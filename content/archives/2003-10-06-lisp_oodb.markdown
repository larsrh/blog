<p>For a few weeks now, I have again been totally fascinated by Lisp and its dialects, have been reading up on it (e.g. with <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com">Paul Graham</a>'s excellent books), and have played around with different implementations. I'm still trying to find the time to write about my thoughts on this ... in the meantime, please admire <a href="http://patricklogan.blogspot.com">Patrick Logan</a>'s brilliant <a href="http://patricklogan.blogspot.com/archives/2003_10_05_patricklogan_archive.html#106520442014053453">example</a> of using <a href="http://kogs-www.informatik.uni-hamburg.de/~moeller/symbolics-info/statice.html">Statice</a> to access a database in Lisp:
</p>
<pre><code>
(defun transfer-between-accounts (from-name to-name amount)
(with-database (db *bank-pathname*)
(with-transaction ()
(decf (account-balance (account-named from-name)) amount)
(incf (account-balance (account-named to-name)) amount)
(when (minusp (account-balance (account-named from-name)))
(error "Insufficient funds in ~A's account" from-name)))))
</code></pre>
