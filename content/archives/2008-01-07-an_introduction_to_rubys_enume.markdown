<blockquote>
<p>Enumerable&#8217;s biggest advantage over the for loop, as we&#8217;ve seen, is clarity. Using Enumerable&#8217;s looping power tools, like any?, all?, and friends makes your code read semantically. Especially combined with Symbol#to_proc, code &#8220;&#8230;seems to describe what I want done instead of how I want the computer to do it.&#8221;, to quote Raganwald.</p>
