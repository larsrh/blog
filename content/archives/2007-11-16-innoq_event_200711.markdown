<p>I&#8217;ve decided to turn talking about our <a href="/blog/st/2007/04/16/innoq_events.html">company-internal events</a> into a habit &#8212; after all, they&#8217;re one of the best things about <a href="/">innoQ</a> (in my not exactly humble opinion). This time, we spent two days in a small town called Wesel, exchanging ideas, listening to various presentations, and discussing all sorts of technical and non-technical things.</p>

<p>Our agenda included a presentation about the use of <a href="http://www.ilog.com/products/jrules/">ILOG&#8217;s JRules</a> in the insurance industry, an only slightly esoteric presentation on semantics in communication, some communication theory (of the human kind), a look at <a href="http://wiki.jboss.org/wiki/Wiki.jsp?page=EmbeddedJBoss">Embedded JBoss</a>, a session about model-to-model transformation with two more in-depth sessions on <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/m2m/atl/">ATL (the Atlas Transformation Language)</a> and <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/gmt/oaw/doc/4.2/html/contents/core_reference.html">openArchitectureWare&#8217;s Xtend</a>, and a nice experiment at the end: everyone had been asked before to prepare two slides for a 5 minutes max. presentation, and we ran a series of these &#8220;flash presentations&#8221; for close to 90 minutes &#8212; a huge amount of triggers, as a start to some more detailed discussions among those interested in any of the topics.</p>

<p>Did I mention that our &#8220;events&#8221; are one of my favorite aspects of innoQ? ;-)</p>
