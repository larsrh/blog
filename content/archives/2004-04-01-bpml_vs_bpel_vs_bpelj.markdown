<p>Another reaction to the BPELJ proposal: <a href="http://www.fairdene.com/bpelj/BPELJ-Enough-Is-Enough.pdf">A paper by Howard Smith</a> (who is CSC&#8217;s CTO (Europe)). Very interesting, especially the historic (if one can already call it that) information about the BMPL/BPEL controversy. Of course it should be taken with a grain of salt, since Howard Smith is not only co-author of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN=0929652339/pfingarA/">a book</a> on Business Process Management, but also co-chair of BPMI.org (the consortium responsible for BPML).</p>
