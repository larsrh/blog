<p><a href="http://uucode.com/blog/">Oleg Paraschenko</a> has introduced <a href="http://xsieve.sourceforge.net/index.html">XSieve</a>, an XML transformation language that combines XSLT and Scheme. Be warned, though &#8212; in his announcement on the xml-dev mailing list he writes:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Everyone isn&#8217;t the audience of XSieve. To use XSLT, one should be very skilled. To use Scheme, one should be very skilled. Therefore, to use XSieve, one should be very very skilled.</p>
