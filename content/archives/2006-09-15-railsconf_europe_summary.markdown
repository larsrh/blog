<p>Unfortunately, I had to leave early to catch my flight (Heathrow Airport, BTW, sucks so much that I will avoid traveling to London for the foreseeable future), so I missed James Duncan Davidson&#8217;s talk. But from my perspective, it was very much worth attending &#8212; I got lots of new ideas and a feel for the Rails community I didn&#8217;t have before. I definitely like it &#8212; it feels very vibrant and explorative and in many other ways very similar to the way I remember the Java community from maybe 8 years ago.</p>

<p>Hey, London has several other airports too, and they&#8217;re all better than a bad day at Heathrow&#8230; if you ever get to fly to/from London City (LCY), it&#8217;s small and efficient and generally great!</p>

<p>well i flew from stansted, which wasn&#8217;t much better to be honest. arriving two hours before my flight i would have still missed it, if it hadn&#8217;t been delayed
so &#8230; the cheap airlines sometimes do have their unexpected advantages ;-)</p>

<p>ah - forgot what took so long; it was the security check, of course.</p>

<p>Yeah, flying out of Stansted is crap these days. Unless you can figure out when all the Ryanair flights go, and avoid them by several hours.) But flying in to Stansted&#8217;s still pretty smooth.</p>

<p>Hi Stefan, I don&#8217;t know if you remember me. We had a short talk last year in Bonn (SOA Days 2005 Technology Conf). But I had to leave to too quickly to get the Bus.
I attended your refreshing presentation at this years SOA Days, too.
I wanted to talk to you again this year, but you left too early ;)</p>
