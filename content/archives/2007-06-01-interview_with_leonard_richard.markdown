<blockquote>
<p>InfoQ publishes a chapter from &#8220;RESTful Web Services&#8221; by Richardson and Ruby; in an accompanying interview, the authors explain their motivations and REST as an alternative to SOAP/WSDL Web services.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Doing <a href="http://www.infoq.com/articles/richardson-ruby-restful-ws">this interview</a> was a lot of fun &#8212; my favorite quote comes from Sam (<em>emphasis mine</em>):</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The thing that changed my mind was a code base called Blosxom initially by Rael Dornfest. [&#8230;] <em>That, and the observation that the number of publicly available SOAP stacks continues to exceed the number of publicly deployed SOAP web services.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Leonard and Sam very, very clearly know what they are talking about. I have little doubt that <a href="http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/9780596529260/">this book</a> is going to be <em>the</em> work on REST for the foreseeable future.</p>
