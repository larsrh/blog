<p><a href="http://www.tallent.us/PermaLink.aspx?guid=96ae2294-f062-4cad-8dbf-7b2ec2dc3dcb">Richard Tallent</a> linked to a new search engine called <a href="http://www.gigablast.com/">Gigablast</a>, so I immediately tried it out. I don&#8217;t yet have an opinion how good it is, but at least my little <a href="http://www.gigablast.com/search?q=tilkov">ego search</a> dug up a funny, and very early <a href="http://cpptips.hyperformix.com/cpptips/cast_mem_layout">posting of mine</a> that even got a reply by a well-know guy.</p>
