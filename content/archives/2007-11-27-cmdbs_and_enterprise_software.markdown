<p><a href="http://www.redmonk.com/cote/2007/11/26/an-open-source-cmdb/">Excellent article</a> by Cot√©, who argues for an open source CMDB (Configuration Management Database):</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The idea of a CMDB is enterprise software at it&#8217;s finest: it&#8217;s middleware without an implicit user-interface, has a wide-scope, means something slightly different to each user and seller, and has yet to be commoditized into freeness and ubiquity. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I see one flaw in his argument, though &#8212; much of a CMDB&#8217;s credibility, similarly to other product categories, results from its price tag: if it cost less, it would be harder to sell. </p>
