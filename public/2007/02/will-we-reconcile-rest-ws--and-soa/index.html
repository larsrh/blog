<blockquote>
<p>Hopefully, 2007 will be the year of reconciliation between both camps. REST proponents would understand and start to address more complex enterprise needs, like integration through business processes and provide more concrete guidance on REST usage and better tooling support. WS-* proponents would finally consider REST as the foundation of their architecture and would slowly refactor their stack of specifications into of simpler and coherent set. Everyone would benefit, first by stopping the waste of energy in endless pro/con arguments. REST would become a respected part of the SOA industry and WS-* would be respected as a real and usable Web Services platform.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Wouldn&#8217;t that be nice &#8230;</p>
