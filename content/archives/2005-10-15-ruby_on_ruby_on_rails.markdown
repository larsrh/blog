<p>hi there&#8230;
I was looking for some info on Ruby on Rails and stumbled upon your site&#8230;
I&#8217;m currently doing some research on this topic cos I find it pretty fascinating&#8230;
just thought I&#8217;d let you know that a good place you might wanna check out for more info is www.blinklist.com &#8230;
they&#8217;re building an info base for Ruby On Rails&#8230; it&#8217;s growing by the day, and they&#8217;re resources are pretty impressive&#8230;
check it out when you have some free time&#8230; and do feel free to contribute if you have some good sources for Ruby on Rails.. I know a few people who are anxious for good sources already, including me! ;)</p>
