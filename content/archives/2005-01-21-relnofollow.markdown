<p>To reduce the incentive for comment and other link spammers to leave links to their sites in innocent people&#8217;s web presences, Google has recently introduced support for <a href="http://www.google.com/googleblog/2005/01/preventing-comment-spam.html">a rel=&#8221;nofollow&#8221; attribute</a> (quickly followed by Yahoo and MSN). I don&#8217;t care enough about this to write a long essay describing why I believe this is a dumb idea, but fortunately <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/BenHammersleysDangerousPrecedent?m=230">Ben Hammersley</a> has already written up everything I would have said. And much more eloquently than I could have done, too.</p>
