<p>This is <a href="http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,1895,1923151,00.asp">the most absurd article</a> I&#8217;ve read in a long time, finally proving that John C. Dvorak has totally lost it. The only reason to link to it is to provide some context for <a href="http://www.geekculture.com/joyoftech/joyarchives/789.html">this cartoon</a>.</p>

<p><em>Update</em>: Read the whole truth <a href="http://www.theappleblog.com/2006/02/16/will-microsoft-adopt-darwin/">here</a> &#8212; it&#8217;s the other way round &#8230;</p>
