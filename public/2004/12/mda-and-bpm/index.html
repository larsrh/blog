	  <p>On Friday, I had the great pleasure to give <a href="/blog/st/presentations/2004/mda-bpm/">a talk</a> on <a href="http://www.omg.org/mda/">Model Driven Architecture</a> and Business Process Management to a bunch of students of the <a href="http://www.fh-hagenberg.at/">FH Hagenberg</a>, an Austrian University located near Linz. It seems there&#8217;s an active software development community located there, placed in a rather idyllic setting. I really enjoy doing stuff like this; it&#8217;s a nice refreshing experience to just being able to do one&#8217;s best to explain a topic one cares about, without any sales or marketing aspect to it. </p>

<p>I&#8217;ve put up <a href="/blog/st/presentations/2004/mda-bpm/">the slides</a>; they&#8217;re not very likely to make any sense to you unless you were one of the people who attended. I&#8217;m still amazed at myself being able to squeeze 4 hours worth of talking out of 40 slides; the best excuse I have for my slides&#8217; poor state is that their basic purpose is to remind me of what I wanted to talk about. </p>

<p>BTW: I played around with different ways to do presentations in the last few weeks. This particular one has been done using John Gruber&#8217;s excellent <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">Markdown</a> (here is the <a href="/blog/st/presentations/2004/mda-bpm/bpm-mda.text">presentation source</a>),  which I fed through a ridiculous <a href="/blog/st/presentations/2004/mda-bpm/fix-slides.pl">little script</a> I wrote to produce a single HTML file in <a href="http://www.meyerweb.com/eric/tools/s5/">S<sup>5</sup> format</a> &#8212; the most important benefit being that I could do the slides using <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/emacs.html">the world&#8217;s most advanced editing environment</a>. It&#8217;s pretty neat to use, although embedding graphics is a pain; one of my next pet projects is going to be conversion of Markdown markup to <a href="http://www.apple.com/keynote/">Keynote</a>&#8217;s <a href="http://developer.apple.com/technotes/tn2002/tn2067.html">XML format</a> :-)</p>
