<p>I&#8217;m late in linking to this, but I found this very interesting: <a href="http://googleresearch.blogspot.com/2006/06/extra-extra-read-all-about-it-nearly.html">Nearly all binary searches and mergesorts are broken</a> &#8230; if they&#8217;re written in mainstream programming languages. <a href="http://patricklogan.blogspot.com/2006/06/integers.html">Patrick Logan</a> and <a href="http://www.cincomsmalltalk.com/blog/blogView?showComments=true&amp;entry=3327122128">James A. Robertson</a> show how other languages get around this problem.</p>
