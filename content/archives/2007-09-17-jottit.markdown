<blockquote>
<p>So <a href="http://jottit.com/">Jottit</a> has launched, only five months after I suggested to my friend Simon that we create a website that was just a big text box people could type stuff into. And there are two ways I look at it. One is: It took us five months to do that? And the other is: We did that in only five months?</p>
