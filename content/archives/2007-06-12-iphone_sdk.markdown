<p><a href="http://www.rogueamoeba.com/utm/posts/News/iphone-sdk-2007-06-11-15-30">So a lot of Mac developers</a> are pissed because the iPhone SDK announced yesterday will actually be Web-based &#8212; i.e. the idea is that you build Web applications if you want to do iPhone apps. I fail to see what&#8217;s wrong with this, because <em>Safari will allow interaction with the iPhone&#8217;s features</em> &#8212; you can make calls, access contacts etc. What more could one ask for?</p>

<p>Had Apple chosen to build a &#8216;real&#8217; SDK (i.e. using Objective C/Cocoa), only Mac developers would have been able to build iPhone applications &#8212; this way, and with the accompanying release of <a href="http://www.apple.com/safari/">Safari for Windows</a>, there are <em>millions</em> of developers who can (and will) build them.</p>

<p>I couldn&#8217;t tell from the keynote whether the iphone would allow disconnected access to those web apps, but I strongly suspect not.  Cingular&#8217;s network is OK, but not great and not available everywhere.  It would be nice if there were a way to &#8220;download&#8221; a web app onto the phone, but obviously that implies a bunch of things (e.g., running everything that was on the web server on the phone) that are unlikely to happen.  Without this, though, no network == no application.</p>

<p>Are you kidding me.  Without an SDK real developers won&#8217;t even be able to consider it as a platform.  Think out of the box.  Web pages can&#8217;t do everything.  This will ultimately lead to the devices demise, and alternatives like palm and microsoft will sell even better.  </p>

<p>I was pumped until I learned no SDK.  So I will now upgrade to the latest palm based Treo, thanks for making up my mind Apple!</p>

<p>Then why bother with an iphone at all? The web based applications you mention already run on a lot of cell phones already.</p>

<p>The thing wrong with safari being the SDK is that it will be /too/ limiting for people to create the &#8216;Killer app.&#8217; There is only so much you can do within the walls of safari.</p>

<p>That only Apple developers will create apps? That is your support for it? Why not both? If they offered a proper SDK, then Apple devs can create the killer apps, and everyone else can add to the pile. You&#8217;d have millions of people creating apps, and thousands of Apple devs creating even better ones.</p>

<p>Perhaps I&#8217;m just terribly dense but I can&#8217;t even find basic (html/javascript) development guidelines anywhere. All I found was iPhoney but I&#8217;m on a PC. Perhaps installing Safari for Windows and NOT installing Flash is as close as I&#8217;ll get?</p>
