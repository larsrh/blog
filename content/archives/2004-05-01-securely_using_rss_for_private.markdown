<p>Interesting <a href="http://www.decafbad.com/blog/2004/04/30/fun_with_shell_scripting">fun with shell scripting</a> over at <a href="http://www.decafbad.com/">0xDECAFBAD</a>; I know a gazillion things I could do with RSS, unfortunately, my <a href="http://ranchero.com/netnewswire/">aggregator of choice</a> does not support accessing feeds served by an un-trusted SSL host. (I&#8217;m also not sure it would support authentication, but haven&#8217;t tried it out). The same is probably true for most other aggregators as well &#8230;</p>
