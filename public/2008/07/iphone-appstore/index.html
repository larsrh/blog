<blockquote>
<p>The appstore is easily the most interesting part of the iPhone, much more than 3G.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I agree whole-heartedly. I believe the AppStore is a great thing from a commercial point of view, both for Apple (obviously), but also for the developers who all have (almost) the same chance to have their app noticed and make a ton of money from it. I understand <a href="http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2008/07/18/Mobile-Net-Gloom">concerns with regards to the openness of the whole thing</a> – but hey, this is a free market and it's not as if anybody forces you to buy into this particular walled garden.</p>

<p>Are you serious, a <em>free market</em>? In the mobile telephony space? Where?</p>

<p>Sure, why not? You might claim (with some reason) that many things suck, but there&#8217;s definitely a lot of competition, and the barrier to entering it doesn&#8217;t seem too hight (except for the core net operation due to frequency licensing, but that&#8217;s no longer the interesting part of the market anyway).</p>

<p>This is kind of incendiary, and I should probably not say it, but mobile telephony seem to me like a free market about as much as the US are a democracy… ;-)</p>

<p>Sure, it follows the form, and in quite a few ways it is, but it is dominated by big incumbents with very similar strategies,  leading to little or no choice in many critical aspects. So it is a far cry from what a healthy situation would look like.</p>
