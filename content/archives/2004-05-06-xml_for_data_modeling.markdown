<p><a href="http://www.mnot.net/blog/2004/05/05/boo">Mark Nottingham </a>  on XOP, SOAP Representation Headers, and whether XML is a good idea for data modeling.</p>

<p>I wonder whether this is the right meta-level &#8212; after all, it&#8217;s not XML you can use for data modeling, but rather XML Schema, RELAX NG, Schematron, or some prose style as used in the WS-* specs. But maybe I&#8217;m missing something.</p>
