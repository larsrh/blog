<p>Finally, even if your company has drank the WS-* kool aid it doesn&#8217;t mean that RESTful APIs are anathema. I&#8217;m pretty sure that no one has drank the WS-* kool aid more than Microsoft but I still see a lot of AJAX [client side Javascript calling back to RESTful or POX APIs] and RSS feeds coming out of the company. A lot more than I see SOAP APIs now that I think about it. :)</p>
