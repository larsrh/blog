<p>As a follow-up to Martin Fowler&#8217;s excellent <a href="http://www.martinfowler.com/articles/languageWorkbench.html">Language Workbench</a> article, <a href="http://lispm.dyndns.org/news?ID=NEWS-2005-07-08-1">Rainer Joswig</a> has put up a video (<a href="http://www.xach.com/bt/dsl-in-lisp.mov.torrent">here</a> is the BitTorrent link) that shows how to build DSLs in Lisp &#8212; very cool.</p>
