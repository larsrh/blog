<p>I&#8217;ve just upgraded our MovableType installation to version 3.3 and will now fool around with the layout until further notice. I only promise to keep the <a href="/blog/st/atom.xml">Atom feed</a> working - no guarantees for anything else. In case you&#8217;re using the RSS 2.0 or RSS 1.0 (RDF) feed, I suggest you switch &#8230;</p>

<p><em>Update</em>: I&#8217;ve restored all of the templates to their MT default, even the style sheet - which is why everything looks nice, but highly generic (like any other MT or TypePad blog). I&#8217;ll explore MT 3.3&#8217;s features, especially around tagging, and then re-introduce the original modifications bit by bit. Please do let me know if anything is broken.</p>

<p>Just testing &#8230; this looks pretty neat.</p>
