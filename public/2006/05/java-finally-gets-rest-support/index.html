	  <p><a href="http://www.markbaker.ca/2002/09/Blog/2006/05/24#deliciousdistobj.Java_gets_REST..._REST">Mark wonders</a> what <a href="http://weblog.infoworld.com/techwatch/archives/006416.html">this</a> is supposed to mean:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Java EE 5 (Java Platform, Enterprise Edition 5), the new version of the platform, supports an alternative Web services technology. <br />Programming in the REST (Representational State Transfer) style is enabled in Java EE 5, said Joe Keller, Sun vice president of marketing for SOA &#38; Integration Platforms. &#8220;The improvement in the Java APIs for Web services included the ability to call in and out of Java using REST,&#8221; Keller said.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I admit that this sounds rather strange, since one of the key points in favor of RESTful HTTP services is that you can provide and consume them on basically any platform &#8212; including Java, which has thus always supported REST. My guess is that what is referred to is the support for RESTful services in JAX-WS 2.0 (which is part Java EE 5). Marc Hadley had <a href="http://weblogs.java.net/blog/mhadley/archive/2006/01/restful_web_ser.html">a good explanation</a> a while back.</p>
