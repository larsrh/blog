<p>Random fragment from the transcript I just reviewed: </p>

<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;WSDL is an idea. WSDL is an abstract, an operation.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Man, that sounds deep. Although what <a href="http://jim.webber.name/">Jim</a> actually said was &#8220;WSDL is an IDL. WSDL&#8217;s abstractions are operations.&#8221;</p>

<p>Also funny was &#8220;the RESTy edge heads&#8221;. At first, it was &#8220;REST had eager&#8221;. Bonus points if you guess what this really stands for &#8230;</p>
