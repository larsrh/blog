<p><a href="http://www.mnot.net/blog/">Mark Nottingham</a> <a href="http://www.mnot.net/blog/2004/01/08/officially_unofficial">reports</a> that Weblogic 8.1 runs on Mac OS X. This is really cool - I just recently discussed the pros and cons of my switch to the Mac platform and its applicability for the &#8220;real&#8221; developers in our company. The non-availability of tools like Weblogic was a major obstacle. Now, if they&#8217;d only make it official &#8230;</p>

<p>Hi!
I read you managed to install Bea WL 8.1 on OS X.
I&#8217;ve tried so far with the, Sun, AIX and Linux versions, but I must be doing smth wrong, it keeps throwing errors at startup&#8230;  (and it&#8217;s not the JAVA_HOME settings, I adapted those)
&#8212;> do you have an accurate Howto for this proces? If you&#8217;d have that, I&#8217;d be VERY thankful! (mail it to me than, please &#8212;> phlamote@mac.com)
Kind Regards,
Philippe</p>
