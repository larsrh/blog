<p>So why do we have all this debate? Its because WS-* implementors (including myself until we did WSO2 Tungsten and Apache Axis2), took the view that REST is not important and ignored it. Duh. We were wrong. Sorry. A thousand apologies. So now, we have a solution: both can be done using one middleware, one programming model and one set of tools.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Which I believe is wrong. Paraphrasing <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/service-orientated-architecture/message/3829">my own comment</a> from the service-orientated architecture mailing list: Similarly to <a href="/blog/st/2005/11/30/service_component_architecture.html">SCA</a>, this approach seem to ignore that there is a larger difference between REST and SOAP than it might seem to a WS proponent at first sight. In REST, you have lots and lots of resources all supporting the same interface; in SOA(P) (at least the wide-spread paradigm), you have few endpoints all supporting different interfaces. In other words, the different is much bigger than just adding a (virtual) SOAP envelope and turning a GET request into XML.</p>

<p>Eloquently put.  The &#8220;nature&#8221; of the service(s) should drive the &#8220;architectural&#8221; style used.  Mixing them both up in the same middleware makes it all the more confusing and complex.</p>

<p>You are really only talking about an implementation detail of how messages are dispatched to handlers. Hence I disagree with you.</p>

<p>Exposing resources rather than endpoints is a difference that is very visible on the wire (as you&#8217;re posting to different URIs that might be served by different applications.) I can&#8217;t see how this could be viewed as an implementation detail.</p>

<p>&#8230; because namespaces their visibility on the wire are an illusion, Stefan. How I create that illusion is an implementaton detail. REST is precisely not about &#8220;this stuff sits here&#8221; but about &#8220;this stuff is mapped here&#8221;.</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t get this point, Clemens. Can you elaborate? Or have you maybe done so in one of your blog entries and I missed it?</p>

<p>Or are you arguing a different point? What I&#8217;m criticizing in the approach taken by Axis2 is that it promotes a POX programming model and calls it REST. I&#8217;m not saying that you can&#8217;t use similar programming models for POX, REST, and SOAP, just that a RESTful application is so different from a SOAPful one that you can&#8217;t hide that behind a common programming model as a detail. In other words, none of the approaches I&#8217;ve seen so far enable the exact same source code to be used for a both a Web services-based and a RESTful approach.</p>

<p>Stefan,</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve actual done something similar where I developed both a REST and SOAP interface to a Work Manager Service. I developed the work manager component in Java and then overlayed a SOAP and REST layer on top of that. </p>

<p>Is that what you&#8217;re talking about?</p>

<p>cheers</p>

<p>Jim - I have no way to tell without more detail :-) I think overlaying both a REST and a SOAP/WSDL layer over the same business logic is certainly possible. Both will, IMO, look pretty different. Did yours?</p>

<p>Not so different. They both mapped to the same underlying OO component model. The skeletons looked different because of the different abstractions (sevice-based and resource based).</p>
