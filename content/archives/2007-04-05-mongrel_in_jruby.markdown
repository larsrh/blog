<blockquote>
<p>As I have told you before, we have been working on getting Mongrel working in JRuby off and on for a long while. One or two months ago, I got the Ragel definition ported correctly and the rest working. The plan is to cooperate with Zed and create a JRuby-native Mongrel gem out there, but until then I will describe the steps you need to take to get this working for yourself.</p>
