<p>+1 to <a href="http://www.intertwingly.net/blog/2006/08/08/WOA-vs-ROA">Sam Ruby&#8217;s post</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The link is the glue that holds the web together.  It is what differentiates the web from protocols like ftp that merely serve as access methods for documents.<br /> <br />The very notion of a link has become practically inexpressible and virtually unthinkable in the vernacular of SOA.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The industry as a whole has become so dependent on abstractions that they&#8217;re used without regards for their benefit.</p>
