	  <p>First of all, you’re likely only reading this because you’re one of
the few remaining souls who rely on RSS/Atom to follow a blog, just
like I do. That’s great! And I apologize for messing with your feed
(it’s quite likely a whole bunch of articles were marked as unread in
your feedreader, something I hate when it happens to me). Sorry.</p>

<p>As you can see (or could see if you bothered to visit the site, which
you probably don’t as it provides a full-text feed so why would you? I
know I wouldn’t), I have tweaked the design a bit to align it a bit
more with our <a href="https://www.innoq.com/en/">main company site</a>, which I
happen to like quite a bit. I also included nicely unobtrusive,
<a href="http://schier.co/blog/2014/10/22/pure-html-share-buttons.html">pure HTML share buttons</a>
(because I keep hearing people like them and didn’t want to include
more JavaScript code provided by a party interested in tracking your
every move then absolutely necessary). Most importantly, the fact that
the whole site is now delivered via HTTPS only is reflected in the
URIs used as IDs for the posts, which is likely the change that
triggered that unread mark.</p>

<p>I will try to treat you better in the future, fellow Atom die-hard.</p>

<p>In the same spirit (less JS), I also removed the Disqus comments. I
love the idea of Disqus (externalized comments), but I hate the
implementation. But if you have feedback to some of the stuff I write,
feel free to <a href="mailto:stefan.tilkov@innoq.com">write me an email</a>! I might not answer immediately (or
rarely not at all), but I’ll try to incorporate whatever you send me
into future posts.</p>
