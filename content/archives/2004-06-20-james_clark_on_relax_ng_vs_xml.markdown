<p>Via <a href="http://www.manageability.org/blog/stuff/the-trouble-with-evolving-xml-schemas">Carlos Perez</a>, I came across <a href="http://www.imc.org/ietf-xml-use/mail-archive/msg00217.html">this link</a> again -- an age-old posting from James Clark about XML Schema's shortcomings (and why he considers RELAX NG to be better). Very interesting; be prepared to lose quite some time if you want to follow the whole thread :-)</p>
