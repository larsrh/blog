<p>I wanted to do some research on one of those ridiculous software patents and open up the <a href="http://www.uspto.gov/">US Patent and Trademark Office</a>&#8217;s home page &#8212; only to learn that there&#8217;s a &#8220;Chief U.S. Intellectual Property Offical&#8221; who is featured prominently with this quote:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Illegally copying computer games, DVDs and other products is just as wrong as stealing these items from the store [&#8230;] Copying and downloading Star Wars video games and movies is not okay&#8212;it&#8217;s breaking the law because it is stealing someone else&#8217;s property.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>One more proof that the current U.S. administration is a bunch of idiots.</p>
