	  <p>These are my unedited notes from Jim Webber's talk at QCon London 2008.
I might have to stop early as I have only some battery left ... we'll see.</p>

<ul>
<li>Invented "Enterprise Manboobs" yesterday (defined as the big bloated ESB middleware -- it's so fat it has manboobs)</li>
<li>Schizophrenic on whether or not to prefer messaging or Web</li>
<li>MESTian with sympathies for RESTafarians</li>
<li>Web services, happily abusing HTTP</li>
<li>Business processes, hosted within services, communicating via messages</li>
<li>The XML fairy sprinkles pixy dust (which may in fact be crack cocaine) on your enterprise systems</li>
<li>In XML pixy dust land, messages are at the center</li>
<li>Except: Web services are evil -- because the messaging vision is as far out of reach</li>
<li>WSDL is the biggest pile of dog shit around</li>
<li>"WSDL is plainly shit. That's a technical term."</li>
<li>WS-HumanTask? WTF?</li>
<li>WSDL 2? Or WSDL too late?</li>
<li>WS-HumanTask? I value my humanity, I don't want to be wrapped in WSDL.</li>
<li>Not everything needs to be an OASIS standard. We know not to take a leak in public. (He said this )</li>
<li>WCF is the best of an extraordinary set of bad toolkits</li>
<li>Toolkits hide messages - WCF at least creates hope before forcing you back into the RPC mindset</li>
<li>Quick pitch for SSDL and Soya</li>
<li>Web Services could rock his world</li>
<li>WSDL has to die.</li>
<li>Sad that Sanjiva is not in the audience.</li>
<li>Things could be nice (SOAP processing model, message, loose coupling by default, composable model)</li>
<li>A lot of the WS-* stack can be ignored most of the time</li>
<li>"Tunneling is all a bunch of tree-hugging hippy crap"</li>
<li>URI tunneling and POX both treat HTTP as a transport</li>
<li>Some Web jihadists don't see this -- pointing explicitly at the Rails community (?)</li>
<li>Web Services tunnel SOAP over HTTP</li>
<li>Lots of Web people doing the same</li>
<li>Worse than SOAP</li>
<li>Example of methods with parameters exposed via URIs</li>
<li>very easy to understand, easy to code, pretty interoperable </li>
<li>BUT it's brittle RPC, tight coupling, no metadata</li>
<li>You can use GET and don't change any state</li>
<li>POX: uses XML in the HTTP request and response to move a call stack between client and server</li>
<li>Example: POSTing your credit card details into some porn site</li>
<li>Simplicity, interoperable, can use complex data structures</li>
<li>BUT: Tight coupling, no metadata support (unless you use a toolkit that supports WSDL w/ the HTTP binding)</li>
<li>RPC is commonplace today</li>
<li>To err is human, to really mess things up you need a computer</li>
<li>To really, really mess things up you need a distributed system</li>
<li>Bad Web services and Web integration have much in common</li>
<li>claimed end of rant (we'll see)</li>
<li>Web fundamentals</li>
<li>Bored lonely physicist Tim never intended the Web to be a middleware platform </li>
<li>Serendipity is great - don't let the RESTafarians tell you different</li>
<li>Roy must have thought: I can combine my love of porn surfing with my PhD</li>
<li>The Web exposes many of the characteristics we want - recoverable, loosely coupled, available, ...</li>
<li>Tenets for Web-based services (for the last time today)</li>
<li>Resource-based, Addressability, Statelessness, Representations, Links, Uniform Interface</li>
<li>Resource architecture - physical resources, logical resources, uniform interface, resource representation, consumer (web client)</li>
<li>Web URIs should be readable, not opaque</li>
<li>Use URI templates to make your resource structure easy to understand (S3 example)</li>
<li>Non-conformance and proud (google later)</li>
<li>Example: Good thing the Library of Congress didn't open up its contents with a link "print this" on every page</li>
<li>PUT is idempotent idempotent. That means you can do the same thing multiple times.</li>
<li>Points out all of the methods, status codes, headers</li>
<li>We have a comprehensive model for distributed computing ... but we still need a way of programming it</li>
<li>The Value of the Web is "linked-ness"</li>
<li>The same is true for the programmatic Web </li>
<li>Shows examples of links</li>
<li>The Web is just like Petri nets - links are state transitions</li>
<li>Microformats are an example of little "s" semantics</li>
<li>Innovation at the edges of the Web - not by some central design authority such as the W3C</li>
<li>Started by embedding machine-processable elements in Web pages -- e.g. calendar information, ...</li>
<li>With microformats, use the rel attribute to describe the semantics of the referred resource</li>
<li>"Subjunctive Programming"</li>
<li>With changing contracts as part of a resource, we can't be too imperative anymore</li>
<li>Doesn't have the cojones to call the Web declarative  </li>
<li>Subjunctive preferred (what if I get a link to pay ...)  </li>
<li>How to implement a typical enterprise workflow look if it's implemented in a Web-friendly way?</li>
<li>Starbuck's example -- it's a bit of a lie, as there is no happy path through Starbuck's</li>
<li>w/ Web services (MEST style), a conversation with a service via exchanging messages with it</li>
<li>The longest interaction you can have supported by WSDL is request/response</li>
<li>It's like a conversation with your demented granny who calls you "Billy"</li>
<li>Advertise it with SSDL or BPEL</li>
<li>What if this were modeled as resources?</li>
<li>Model workflow stages as resources, state transitions as hyperlinks/URI templates</li>
<li>First, do a POST to /order, Starbuck's returns 201 Created + a URI</li>
<li>In the returned representation, there's a link rel='pay'</li>
<li>If I make a mistake, I ask for my OPTIONS</li>
<li>If it says I'm allowed a PUT, I can update it (PUT)</li>
<li>Send an Expect: 100-continue (would it be OK?)</li>
<li>200 OK, yes you can</li>
<li>So do the PUT</li>
<li>If it fails, do it again (it's idempotent idempotent)</li>
<li>as the resource doesn't remember interactions, use If-Unmodified-Since and get back a 412 Precondition failed if something is wrong</li>
<li>If I do the PUT too late, I could get 409 Conflict</li>
<li>A new OPTIONS call says it's readonly now</li>
<li>Following the payment link: POST to the order payment resource</li>
<li>New payment created, its URI returns</li>
<li>How do I know to POST? Via OPTIONS</li>
<li>Now if I get the order again, no payment link any more</li>
<li>Starbucks can have some resources that are private, but can also access the same resources</li>
<li>There could be an Atom feed of orders</li>
<li>HTTP auth can be used to enforce only Starbuck's can access specific resources (401 unauthorized)</li>
<li>Lessons: HTTP has a header/status combination for everything</li>
<li>APIs are expressed in terms of links, and they're cool</li>
<li>AtomPub is a blueprint to develop similar protocols</li>
<li>(Although the Atom guys will tell you Atom is all you'll ever need)  </li>
<li>APIs can also be constructed with URI templates and inference</li>
<li>XML is fine, but other options like APP, JSON or maybe XHTML as a middle ground</li>
<li>Summary: both the Web and Web services community suffer from piss-poor patterns and practices and awful tooling</li>
<li>Both platforms are about externalizing state machines when done well</li>
<li>WS-* is bloated, but most of it can and should be ignored</li>
<li>The Web is now starting to feel the love from middleware vendors - beware!</li>
<li>Sends shivers up his spine - not convinced it needs the Java API love, no equivalent to JAX-WS on the Web</li>
<li>MEST and REST are both sensible approaches</li>
<li>Question: In the Starbuck's example, how realistic is it because of the limits of most Web servers? </li>
<li>Answer: Maybe not today, but a year or so from now ...</li>
<li>Question: Link with the payment - would you define some kind of schema for that?</li>
<li>Answer: Should the IETF have the only set of definitions? No, he would like to be able to link to a description</li>
<li>Question: Degree of freedom may end up creating problems</li>
<li>Answer: Things can appear to close semantically, but different in their implementation -- it would be nice if these things were consistent, but if they're not, so what</li>
<li>Some of the people who advocate the Web claim the Web is simple -- they're stupid</li>
<li>It's not easier -- creating a good system requires thought</li>
<li>Question: Should the contract be defined formally?</li>
<li>Answer: WADL (doesn't like it, similar to WSDL), just accept there are links, or create something new (currently happening)</li>
<li>Question: Doesn't the client have to be too intelligent?</li>
<li>Answer: True, this is tricky because the client has to be prepared for many things. Having to be declarative, we know we have to be ready for everything. There's additional work ...</li>
<li>Udi: There's intelligence involved -- there are programmers building stuff</li>
<li>If it were this intelligent, it would be like SkyNet (probably some W3C working group somewhere)</li>
<li>Caching in the Web means caching cheaply and getting it right</li>
</ul>
