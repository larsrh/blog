<p>It&#8217;s questionable whether comparing RMI to Web services is worth pursuing, but <a href="http://www.sigs-datacom.de/sd/news/document?PID=250">this article</a> (German) highlights the difference between SOAP stack implementations &#8212; it&#8217;s not exactly news to me that WASP blows Axis away, but it can&#8217;t hurt for more people to know :-)</p>
