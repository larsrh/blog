<p><a href="http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2004/05/17/WS-Rumble">Tim Bray</a> writes about the ongoing debate about <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/dnglobspec/html/wsrmspecindex.asp">WS-ReliableMessaging</a> vs. <a href="http://xml.coverpages.org/OASIS-WS-Reliability-2004-03-10.pdf">WS-Reliability</a>, specifically <a href="http://webpages.charter.net/chrisfer/blog.html">Chris Ferris</a>&#8217;s comparison, a <a href="http://lists.oasis-open.org/archives/wsrm/200404/msg00086.html">protest by Hitachi&#8217;s Bob Freund</a> (where I&#8217;m not sure how much tongue-in-cheek it&#8217;s intended to be), and the WSRM TC&#8217;s <a href="http://www.oasis-open.org/events/symposium/slides/wsrm_notes.pdf">response</a>. I don&#8217;t really care that much about the differences, but I think it&#8217;s great that at least there is some debate going on &#8212; maybe we&#8217;ll end up with a <em>single</em> open, broadly-supported standard in the end &#8230;</p>
