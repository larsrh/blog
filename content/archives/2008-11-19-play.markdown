<p><a href="http://www.playframework.org/">Play!</a> looks really cool at first sight:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Play! framework makes it easier to build Web applications with Java. It's a clean alternative to bloated Enterprise Java stacks. It focuses on developers productivity and targets RESTfull architectures.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Obviously very much inspired by Rails' handling of HTTP-to-code mapping.</p>
