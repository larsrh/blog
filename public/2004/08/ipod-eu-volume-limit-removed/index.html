<p>The volume limit is there for a very good reason. Consistently listening to noise levels higher than the limit <em>will</em> damage your ears. If you really love music, you will protect your hearing. Take it from someone who has developed tinnitus from listening to loud music. It&#8217;s not fun. And it&#8217;s permanent.</p>

<p>So what? Depending on your habits, you may listen to heavy metal constantly for hours, or you could listen to music with a lot of dynamics &#8212; the potential for damage will certainly be different for both options. I know of no car stereo or home equipment that enforces some limit, so why start here?</p>
