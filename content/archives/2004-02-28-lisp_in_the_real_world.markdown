<p>A very interesting comment in <a href="http://discuss.fogcreek.com/joelonsoftware/default.asp?cmd=show&#38;ixPost=31402">Joel Spolksy&#8217;s discussion forum</a>:</p>

<blockquote> If I started up my very own major software project now, I would make my language decision based on the criteria above. Sure, I love Lisp, CLOS is awesome, real lexical scoping rocks, Lisp macros are way cool (when used as directed), and personally I really like Lisp syntax. [&#8230;] But it would take a lot, or require special circumstances, to persuade me to choose Lisp for a major software project, if I were in charge of making the choice.</blockquote>

<p>It&#8217;s interesting not only because of its content, but because it has been written by <a href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?DanWeinreb">Dan Weinreb</a>, whose LISP competency can&#8217;t really be in doubt ;-)</p>
