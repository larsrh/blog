Good news: SE Radio <a href="http://www.se-radio.net/2017/01/were-listening/">has decided to stop the ad</a> I was offended by, and will even remove it from past episodes. I think that is pretty great for the show’s listeners and for the show itself.

As for me, I won’t return to the show. We’re parting on good terms, no hard feelings on either side. On the contrary: I encourage you to listen to the show – I know I will continue to do so, it’s pretty great.

Nevertheless, I’ll be taking the chance to start a new podcast, together with a few of my former show hosts and some esteemed co-workers. Preparations are progressing smoothly, and I expect I’ll be able to announce something over the next few days.
