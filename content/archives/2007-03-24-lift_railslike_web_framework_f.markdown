<blockquote>
<a href="http://liftweb.net/">lift</a> is yet another web development framework. lift runs inside a Java web container and uses the <a href="http://scala-lang.org/">Scala</a> programming language for coding. lift stresses security, developer productivity, ease of deployment, ease of maintainability, performance, and compatibility with existing systems.
<br />
lift borrows from the best of existing frameworks including <a href="http://seaside.st/">Seaside</a>&#8217;s highly granular sessions and security, <a href="http://www.rubyonrails.com/">Rails</a> fast flash-to-bang, Django&#8217;s &#8220;more than just CRUD is included&#8221;, and <a href="http://erlyweb.org/">Erlyweb</a>&#8217;s scalability for Comet-style applications.
<br />
lift is built on Scala, a hybrid Functional and O-O language that compiles code down to the Java Virtual Machine. Scala code can call any Java code and make use of all Java classes. Java code can call some Scala code. lift applications are packaged as WAR files and can be deployed on any Servlet 2.4 engine (e.g., Tomcat 5.5.xx, Jetty 6.0, etc.)
<br />
lift code is as clean and brief as Rails, yet performs 6 times faster and is multithreaded. Additionally, because Scala is strongly typed, the compiler catches type errors.

<p>Interesting, if only because it uses Scala (which <a href="/blog/st/2005/09/09/scala.html">I&#8217;ve liked before</a>).</p>
