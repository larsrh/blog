<p>I did another interview for InfoQ, this time with WSO2&#8217;s <a href="http://www.bloglines.com/blog/sanjiva">Sanjiva Weerawarana</a>, who did his best to defend the WS-* vision. <a href="http://www.infoq.com/articles/sanjiva-rest-myths">Make up your own mind whether he succeeded</a>. I can honestly say I had to seriously restrain myself to not lose my &#8220;neutrality&#8221; completely :-)</p>
