<p>After spending days convincing innoQ&#8217;s CTO, <a href="/blog/pg/">Phillip Ghadir</a>, to take the blogging habit seriously, he finally gives in &#8212; and I promptly forget to link to him. Herewith a link to still <a href="/blog/pg/archives/001137.html">fairly recent writing</a> about what I believe will become a strong influential factor in future releases of our MDA product, <a href="/iqgen">iQgen</a>; if you&#8217;re looking for a an MDA-related weblog with an excellent signal-to-noise ratio, Phillip should be high on your list &#8230;</p>
