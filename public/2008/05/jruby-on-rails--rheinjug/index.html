	  <p>Last Thursday, I had a lot of fun talking about JRuby on Rails at the <a href="http://www.rheinjug.de/">Düsseldorf Java User Group</a> -- I had a great audience with smart questions and a topic I'm really excited about. As usual, I've put <a href="/blog/st/presentations/2008/2008-05-09-JRuby--JUGD.pdf">the slides online</a>.</p>

<p>Hard to say &#8230; I wasn&#8217;t able to take notes, for obvious reasons :-)</p>

<p>Many of the concerns were the ones that are to be expected - static typing and its ties to refactoring, performance, scalability, integration with existing Java codebase, suitability for large projects &#8230; </p>

<p>I have been there and listened to the talk - it was great fun! The topic was very interesting and the way you gave the talk was very good - informative, good to follow, a lot of humor, very inspiring. The talk really motivated me to have a much closer look at Ruby/JRuby.</p>
