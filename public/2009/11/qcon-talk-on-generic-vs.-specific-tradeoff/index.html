	  <p>At <a href="http://qconlondon.com/london-2009/">QCon London in March</a>, I talked about some thoughts on generic vs. specific solutions. <a href="http://www.infoq.com/presentations/Generic-Specific-Tradeoffs-Stefan-Tilkov">The video is now online at InfoQ.</a> I wasn&#8217;t at all sure whether this would work; I like to think it did :-)</p>

<p>Really nice talk! There are, of course no easy answers to these questions as we&#8217;re starting to enter the realm of human creativity and intuition in design.  The best we can hope for, I think is guidance that will help people to avoid the obvious mistakes. But the creation of really great solutions is still much more of an art than a science.</p>

<p>Also, be careful as once you&#8217;ve been a &#8220;disillusioned architect&#8221; for a few years, and always answer &#8220;it depends&#8221;, many people will start taking you less seriously!  Our industry is always looking for simple and quick answers to everything and one can very easily get a reputation for being &#8220;difficult&#8221; or &#8220;making things too complicated&#8221;.  There is always some young (but just about credible) whippersnapper around who will say &#8220;it&#8217;s obvious - the answer is this - let&#8217;s just get on and do it&#8221;. Sometimes you need to remember this, hide your internal self doubt and &#8220;pretend&#8221; that the answer is simple, just in order to be able to move things forward.  It&#8217;s part of the skills of leadership&#8230;</p>

<p>Thanks! Good to hear from you again. And yes, I&#8217;m well aware of the problem with &#8220;it depends&#8221; – simply following logic, we&#8217;d always be asking questions only, and never give any answers … which is highly unlikely to be paid for by anyone.</p>
