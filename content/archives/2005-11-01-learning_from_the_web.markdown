<p>Adam Bosworth has written a <a href="http://acmqueue.com/modules.php?name=Content&amp;pa=printer_friendly&amp;pid=337&amp;page=1">great article</a> for ACM queue. <a href="http://www.coactus.com/blog/2005/11/principled-sloppiness/">Mark Baker</a> and <a href="http://dannyayers.com/archives/2005/11/01/semi-structured-data-articles/">Danny Ayers</a> have some comments.</p>

<p>I agree with Mark&#8217;s point about Adam&#8217;s use of &#8220;sloppy&#8221; &#8212; I believe they both consider the way (some) web protocols are built superior to a design process aiming for perfection, although some might be taken aback by that choice of words.</p>
