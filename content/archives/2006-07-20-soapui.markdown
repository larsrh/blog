<blockquote>
<p>soapui is a desktop application for inspecting, invoking, developing and functional/load/compliance testing of web services over HTTP. It is mainly aimed at developers/testers providing and/or consuming web services (java, .net, etc). Functional and Load-Testing can be done both interactively in soapui or within an automated build/integration process using the soapui command-line tools. soapui currently requires java 1.5 and is licensed under the LGPL license.</p>
