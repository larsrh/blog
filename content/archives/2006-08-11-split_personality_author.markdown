<blockquote>
<p>We have already written the proposal for a &#8220;let&#8217;s analyze this Web-based integration phenomenon book&#8221; and it has received good comments. Expect a book with a strong taste of HTTP, some REST aroma, a small touch of message-orientation, garnish of Web Services, a leaf of semantics and knowledge representation (if I get my way :-), lots of syndication, and much more (I don&#8217;t want to spoil it for you by revealing all the ideas :-). That should make a good recipe for, what we think, is going to be an interesting and much needed book for a world where the Web is the application/integration platform.</p>

<p>Very much looking forward to it!</p>
