<p>It&#8217;s been exactly 365 days since I&#8217;ve quit smoking, and I had to hunt around for an image of my (former) favorite brand on the Web for quite some time. The one empty package I&#8217;d saved to be scanned for the purpose has long been lost somewhere.</p>

<p>I started smoking when I was 16, and pretty much constantly smoked between 20 and 40 unfiltered cigarettes per day. There was one brief interruption, for about 6 months, when I managed to quit and then started again (with the occasional cigarette borrowed from some colleague).  </p>

<p>This time, I spent some three weeks thinking about starting again, and then never wasted a thought on it again. </p>

<p>So how did I manage to do it? I believe it was actually because I somehow realized that quitting is, in fact, no big deal. (That, and some food poisoning to spoil a few days of my life where I felt like everything but smoking). And I don&#8217;t even feel so much better, or healthier, and run around claiming I&#8217;m reborn now &#8212; it&#8217;s just a lot easier from a logistical point of view to not having to quit meetings for a cigarette break, not having to make sure I have the amount of cigarettes I need for the day with me, not stepping outside into the cold in the middle of winter &#8230; Prolonging my life for a few years as a side effect doesn&#8217;t hurt, of course.</p>

<p>Don&#8217;t think. Just quit. No big deal. <em>That&#8217;s</em> the secret, you know.</p>
