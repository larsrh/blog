<p><a href="http://webpages.charter.net/chrisfer/2005/02/over-under-sideways-down.html">Chris has another post</a> in the continuing MEST permathread, very much worth reading:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Jim, citing the Waldo et al paper, correctly points out how things start collapsing like a house of cards when we fail to heed the collective wisdom in that paper. (Recall the infamous eight fallacies of distributed computing. Anyone designing a distributed system who does not first stop to cherish and grok these words of wisdom should be forced to have a scarlet &#8216;E&#8217; tattooed on their forehead! But, I digress.).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Although I hold both <a href="http://jim.webber.name/">Jim</a> and <a href="http://savas.parastatidis.name/">Savas</a> in high regard, I have the strange feeling that the MEST label, introduced because of the aimed similarity with REST, causes more trouble than benefit.</p>

<p>Hey Stefan,</p>

<p>It used to be called &#8220;ProcessMessage&#8221; if you recall, but it clearly owes so much to the thinking behind REST (and its advocates) that we felt we should pay homage with our naming.</p>

<p>Hi Jim - yes, I do recall that. In fact, I kind of followed MEST from its inception through the various discussions it went through &#8230; My point, though, is that the similarity hinted at by the naming is not that large, and that in fact you and Savas are &#8220;just&#8221; (no offence intended) following what many second generation WS proponents, including myself, perceive to be the right way to do Services. </p>

<p>But I&#8217;m very much looking forward to your paper and postpone (semi-)final judgement until then :-)</p>
