<p>SLIME is an Emacs mode for working with Lisp; <a href="http://wingolog.org/archives/2006/01/02/slime">this</a> is a great description of its features [via <a href="http://www.holgerarendt.de/uncommented/#2330">Holger Arendt</a>].</p>

<p><a href="http://www.holgerarendt.de/uncommented/">Holger&#8217;s weblog</a>, BTW, is called &#8220;uncommented&#8221; &#8212; which describes it very correctly: just links and quotes, never (IIRC) a statement or explicit judgement (other than the ones implied by linking in the first place). Nevertheless (or maybe therefore?) it&#8217;s one of my favorites.</p>
