	  <p>I am at a total loss to understand my blog&#8217;s <a href="http://www.technorati.com/cosmos/search.html?rank=&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.innoq.com%2Fblog%2Fst%2F">Technorati search results</a>. They used to be pretty useful, but all I can see now is links from my own blog to itself. I have no idea what causes this, and I have not seen this with other blogs I have tried to get the cosmos for.</p>

<p>Hmm, when I look up your link-cosmos it says &#8220;Stefan Tilkov&#8217;s Random Stuff has 65 Links from 12 Sources&#8221;.</p>

<p>Many of them are from your Blog, but not all of them.</p>

<p>Thanks for checking - yes, I have the same results. However, I have never seen this with other blogs, although they also reference their own posts, have a list of recent entries on the home page, etc. I&#8217;m trying to find out what&#8217;s causing this useless (to me at least) self-referencing links to appear.</p>

<p>OK, so I took &#8220;all I can see&#8221; a little too literally.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve seen this for some other blogs from time to time but must admit that I fail to understand why it happens as well.</p>
