<p>I&#8217;m currently describing roles that apply to a SOA approach (more on this soon). I currently have four roles:</p>

<ul>
<li>Service Designer &#8212; responsible for designing business services</li>
<li>SOA Business Architect &#8212; tasked with maintaining the overall service map</li>
<li>SOA Platform Architect &#8212; responsible for the SOA backplane </li>
</ul>

<p>Now I need a good name for the fourth role whose responsibility it is to set up and ensure compliance to standards and guidelines &#8212; i.e., performance governance-related functions.</p>

<p>So, kind reader: Any suggestions for a good name for this role (short of what you&#8217;re called by London taxi driver)?</p>

<p>Stefan, imho its pretty obvious: either call her &#8220;SOA-Governesse&#8221; or &#8220;SOA-Governor&#8221; - her responsibility is clearly &#8220;SOA Governance&#8221;. She will be member of the SOA-Governance board, will be fluent in architecture guidelines and all those (boring) compliance stuff.</p>

<p>In newer literature you find the term &#8220;repistry&#8221; for the combo of registry and repository - that could make up another suggestion for the roles&#8217; name: &#8220;SOA-repistress&#8221; :-)</p>

<p>Try it out with your wife - just give her my regards and (once and never again) call her &#8220;repistress&#8221; - but do not forget to start running when the second sylable leaves your mouth :-))</p>

<p>regards from cologne (could&#8217;ve told you that on the phone a few minutes ago &#8230;)

<p>As I said, Gov&#8217;nor is not an option (see <a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=gov'nor" rel="nofollow" /><a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=gov&#8217;nor" rel="nofollow">http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=gov&#8217;nor</a> ;-)</p>

<p>The &#8220;repistry&#8221; moniker sucks so much I promise this is the last time I use it. </p>

<p>Cheers,
Stefan</p>

<p>I&#8217;d probably go for &#8220;SOA Compliance Officer&#8221;, but I must admit that it doesn&#8217;t sound very appealing&#8230; If you&#8217;re like me, you wouldn&#8217;t like to see that written under your name on an orgchart. :-)</p>

<p>&#8220;SOA Patron&#8221; maybe?</p>

<p>Don&#8217;t mess with an Office of the Law ;-) Right, that doesn&#8217;t sound too great, either.</p>

<p>I would suggest this role is some kind of &#8220;supervisor&#8221; or &#8220;guard&#8221; because this person is responsible for the rule-compliant use of the SOA by Service designers, architects or developers&#8230;</p>
