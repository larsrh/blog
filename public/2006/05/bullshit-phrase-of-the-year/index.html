	  <p>Via <a href="http://blogs.technet.com/michael_platt/archive/2006/05/25/430391.aspx">Michael Platt</a>, I came across <a href="http://home.businesswire.com/portal/site/google/index.jsp?ndmViewId=news_view&amp;newsId=20060516006173&amp;newsLang=en">this Gartner gem</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Enterprise architects must act as catalysts that speed the formation of unified business technology strategies and their execution. The enterprise architecture process must shift gears from limiting complexity by limiting choices to accelerating innovation and execution by coordinating complexity through unified business and IT strategy, decentralized execution and loose coupling among all related stakeholder disciplines.</p>

<p>An just the lead in to that paragraph was priceless: &#8220;Operate All Revenue Generating Channels in a Web 2.0 Architecture&#8221; &#8212; just try to turn that into an plan that you can execute against and measure; especially now that &#8216;web 2.0&#8217; is a trademarked term that no one seems to be able to define consistently.</p>

<p>To be fair, the trademark covers conferences only &#8230; still, I&#8217;m confident I&#8217;ll be able to use phrases from this particular article for a long time.</p>
