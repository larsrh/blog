	  <p>For the last few months, I&rsquo;ve been continuously tweaking my laptop
settings to optimize my typing speed and efficiency. Here are some of
the things I&rsquo;ve learned, and some of the tools and approaches I&rsquo;m
currently using.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>I finally took up &ldquo;real&rdquo; touch typing, i.e. using 10 fingers and a
classical system. For years I&rsquo;d been quite satisfied, even a little
proud, of my awesome typing skillz, only to be shot down when I took
the first real speed typing test and found myself scoring a ridiculous 30-40
words per minute, the reason being mostly mistakes and the
&ldquo;occasional&rdquo; peeking if some not-so-common character came along. There
are a ton of tools for learning touch typing. The one I spent the most
time with is the excellent (and free) <a href='http://www.tipp10.com/en/index/'>Tipp10</a>, which is available in
both offline and online versions. There&rsquo;s also the very nicely done
<a href='https://itunes.apple.com/en/app/keys/id526394170?mt=12'>Keys</a> if you&rsquo;re on a Mac and have a US keyboard. If you like to have
some social interaction, both <a href='http://10fastfingers.com/'>10 Fast Fingers</a> and <a href='http://play.typeracer.com/'>Typeracer</a> are also
quite nice. Finally, for a programmer, <a href='http://typing.io/'>typing.io</a> is a fantastic resource.</p></li>

<li><p>I switched to a US keyboard layout a while ago. I don&rsquo;t know why
I&rsquo;d put this off for so long; while I originally started out using a
German keyboard layout (QWERTZ instead of QWERTY), I easily write half
of what I produce in English, so it wouldn&rsquo;t have hurt to do this
earlier. The most important benefits are that almost all of the
characters required in programming languages are far easier to type
using a US keyboard and all of the keyboard shortcuts, particularly in
editors such as my favorite, Emacs, suddenly make a lot more
sense. Because I still type a lot of German texts and hated the
default input method for umlauts and the German &ldquo;&szlig;&rdquo;, I installed <a
href='http://hci.rwth-aachen.de/USGermanKeyboard'>the great &ldquo;USGerman&rdquo; keyboard layout</a>, which allows me to use Option+a, u, o and s to
get the appropriate characters with a single combination. This has
turned out to be a very workable solution.</p></li>

<li><p>It also made me use Cmd for Meta in Emacs, which is both good and bad:
It&rsquo;s good because when you use Emacs, you use Meta a lot; it&rsquo;s bad,
because some of the keyboard shortcuts for moving around now need to
be done with Cmd (in Emacs) and Option (everywhere else), which can be
a bit annoying. Also, I ordered my new laptop with a German keyboard
layout by accident, which ended up being great because it means I now
have no chance to actually look at the keyboard for those special
characters anymore. (It also allowed me to turn the keyboard lighting
all the way down.)</p></li>

<li><p>Speaking of Emacs, I wanted to make sure I have the Emacs short
cuts available everywhere. This is actually the case to a large degree
by default on a Mac, but I wanted to be able to rely on combinations
such as Ctrl-M, Ctrl-H, Ctrl-I, etc. Enter the slightly ugly, stupidly
named, but incredibly powerful <a href='https://pqrs.org/macosx/keyremap4macbook/index.html.en'>KeyRemap4MacBook</a>, which allowed me to
ensure Emacs keys work everywhere. (I hear this is possible for vi
users, too.)</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Now I find myself not taking my fingers off home row very much, and I&rsquo;m
comfortably moving along at 60-80 wpm. There&rsquo;s a weird satisfaction in
this &ndash; I noticed that in a recent company-internal discussion, many
of my co-workers did not seem to see much of a point in taking up
touch-typing because they don&rsquo;t see typing speed as the limiting
factor. One reason I might see this differenly is because I (sadly) don&rsquo;t
program much these days, but produce a lot of prose instead. And there, at
least, I&rsquo;m absolutely confident that not having your typing get in the
way is a huge asset.</p>
