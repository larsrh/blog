<p>I have always hated RealPlayer, and I even thought about writing about it some day. It turns out that there&#8217;s no need because <a href="http://jogin.com/weblog/archives/000504/">Tomas Jogin</a> has written everything that needs to be written already.</p>

<p>Real Player is beyond a doubt the worst media player that ever was. Every successive version seems to suck more and have even more annoying features that don&#8217;t work. Its actually a virus, but since most people implementing it are braindead, they think its a good idea.</p>

<p>Real Player actually improved even though it is still a piece of shit. I use the free version (Real Player 10 Gold bb). You have to be a real dick to pay for Real Player. I remove Realsched an the crummy Google Toolbar it also installs and it runs quite well now. But Real Player does suck.</p>

<p>Real Player is actually an anagram for LARRY E. PALE the ASSHOLE who developed this piece of shit program.  Hey, Larry&#8230;REAL PLAYER&#8230; SUCKS, SUCKS, SUCKS.
It is the SUCKIEST of all the sucky programs that ever sucked.  I mean it REALLY SUCKS.  If real player was a real PERSON&#8230;which it is (Larry E. Pale)
he&#8217;d SUCK BIG TIME. It sucks so bad it couldn&#8217;t even get a job in a Bangkok whorehouse.  It sucks so bad that Michael Jackson would delete it even if it was a 12 year old white boy.  It sucks so bad that an 85 year old blind guy with one leg wouldn&#8217;t even pay for it. IT sucks MORE than the second season of Saved by the Bell.  It sucks more than George Bush&#8217;s foreign policy.  It even sucks more than Jennifer Lopez&#8230;and she REALLY SUCKS!!! ROYALLY!!!</p>
