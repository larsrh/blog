<p>Continuing to drive interoperability between its Java technology and the .NET platform, Sun Microsystems, Inc. (NASDAQ: SUNW) today <a href="http://www.sun.com/smi/Press/sunflash/2005-11/sunflash.20051104.1.html">announced</a> it will help facilitate interoperability with the Windows Communication Foundation (WCF) via developing and distributing open source implementations of key WS*-specifications. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Why is that newsworthy, you ask? </p>

<p>I have no idea. </p>

<p>First of all, it&#8217;s not as if the <a href="http://java.sun.com/webservices/jwsdp/index.jsp">JWSDP</a> hasn&#8217;t been around for years, and as if it hadn&#8217;t been obvious that more and more WS-* specs would have to be added as they become available. Secondly, I don&#8217;t think anybody uses Sun&#8217;s implementation, anyway &#8230;

<p>Stefan, </p>

<p>I agree with your point that almost no one uses Sun&#8217;s JWSDP implementation. But I still think this news is newsworthy &#8212; at least a little bit &#8212; mostly because it shows support for the next generation of the web services framework.</p>

<p>Microsoft WCF (formerly known as &#8220;Indigo&#8221;) provides automatic support for secure, reliable, transacted web services using WS-Security, WS-ReliableMessaging, and WS-AtomicTransaction. But in order to use these extended capabilities, you must also use SOAP 1.2. If Sun is committing to interoperate with WCF, then that also implies a commitment to support SOAP 1.2. I&#8217;m always encouraged to see any vendor announce plans to support SOAP 1.2. Perhaps Sun&#8217;s move will encourage other vendors to follow suit and implement full support for SOAP 1.2</p>

<p>I&#8217;m also always encouraged to see any vendor commit to providing open source implementations. (I&#8217;ve not been especially happy with the way Sun conducts its open source projects, but that&#8217;s a different matter.) Based on past projects, I assume that Sun will distribute the source under the CDDL license.</p>
