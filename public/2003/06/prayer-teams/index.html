<p>To the Body of Christ,
I am a Christian, who needs your Prayers, I have just returned from Iraq, I served in the Army for 8 months in the sand, and unfortunately the Enemy used that time to try to destroy my family, but I believe with you prayers it can be reversed. My name is Mike My wife is Julie we have 3 young Children Jacob age 8, Olivia age 5, and Robyn age 4, My wife who is a Christian has taken up with somebody else I believe his name is George. I’m asking that you pray and Storm Heaven, to break up this relationship as it is written in Hosea 2:6. (A hedge of thorns around Julie)
Hosea 2     Read This Chapter
2:6 &#8220;Therefore, behold, I will hedge up her way with thorns, And I will build a wall against her so that she cannot find her paths.
2:7 &#8220;She will pursue her lovers, but she will not overtake them; And she will seek them, but will not find {them.} Then she will say, &#8217; I will go back to my first husband, For it was better for me then than now!&#8217; </p>

<p>And that you would ask our Lord Jesus to reconcile through his life giving blood, the Reconciliation of my wife to himself (Jesus) and our Marriage, Please help me wage war and save my family, and allow my Children to see the power of a praying body, that they may serve the Lord all there lives, I am indebted to you may God bless you your church and family.
In Christ
