<blockquote>
<p>I don&#8217;t think people are embracing REST services because of architectural purity (the rest of the Web isn&#8217;t pure REST, so&#160;I don&#8217;t know why this would be). Rather, they embrace it because it&#8217;s easier in a lot of cases. There is no reason that SOAP couldn&#8217;t be the same, except that toolkits hide raw XML and you have to know how to get it.</p>

<p>I <a href="/blog/st/2004/09/29/rest_popularity.html">couldn&#8217;t agree more</a>.</p>
