<p><a href="http://www.math.uchicago.edu/~chruska/recursive/moser.html">This Is the Title of This Story, Which Is Also Found Several Times in the Story Itself</a> &#8212; I read it first about 15 years ago in Douglas R. Hofstadter&#8217;s  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0465045669/sr=8-1/qid=1146518737/ref=pd_bbs_1/103-0788220-6271008?%5Fencoding=UTF8">Metamagical Themas</a>. Highly recommended &#8212; in fact, his <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0465086454">Le ton beau de Marot</a> is my all-time favorite non-fiction book (although of course no one can call himself a geek without having read <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0465026567">G&#246;del, Escher, Bach)</a>.</p>
