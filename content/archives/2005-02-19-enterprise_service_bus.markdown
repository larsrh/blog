<p>Interested in what an <em>Enterprise Service Bus</em> really is? Look no further than <a href="http://www-306.ibm.com/software/info1/websphere/index.jsp?tab=landings/esbbenefits&#38;S_TACT=103BGW01&#38;S_CMP=campaign">IBM&#8217;s definition</a> &#8212; very clearly the most meaningless drivel I&#8217;ve encountered in a long time.</p>
