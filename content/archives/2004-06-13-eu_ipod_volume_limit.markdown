<p>In case there&#8217;s any kind soul running a US 3G iPod reading this: I&#8217;d be eternally grateful if I could get my hands on the US firmware. It seems that due to a stupid French law, <em>all</em> European iPods come with a limit on the maximum volume. While there seems to be <a href="http://www.bsodmike.com/ipodnocap.html">a way around this</a>, it requires access to an original US iPod firmware &#8230; just send me <a href="mailto:stefan.tilkov@innoq.com">an email</a> and I will pass along instructions.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong>  I have already tried to get the firmware off a friend&#8217;s US iPod, which failed because he was running iTunes on Windows (obviously the hard drive gets formatted differently, and the instructions I have won&#8217;t work). So only iPod/Mac OS X users will be able to help me &#8230;</p>
