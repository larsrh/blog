<p>From an <a href="http://www.infoworld.com/article/05/05/05/HNjavaat10_1.html">InfoWorld article</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>That Java&#8217;s 10th birthday would even be remembered seemed an unlikely possibility in 1995. At that time, Java was an obscure technology left over from a failed interactive TV venture called FirstPerson. But with the World Wide Web taking off, the FirstPerson team somehow managed to convince Sun&#8217;s legal department to let it  take the unprecedented step of releasing the Java source code to the public.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Sounds like fake history to me &#8212; I&#8217;m pretty sure Sun&#8217;s &#8220;open sourcing&#8221; Java (if you want to call it that) didn&#8217;t have much to do with its success.</p>
