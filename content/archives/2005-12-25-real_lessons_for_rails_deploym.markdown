<p>Here&#8217;s a fact of life about <a href="http://rubyonrails.com/">Rails</a>: Deployment of a Rails application can get complicated. Fast. There are a lot of different ways to do it and everybody&#8217;s situation is slightly different. This can be a total bummer because it&#8217;s so damn easy to get started with Rails. And, now that Rails 1.0.0 supports lighttpd out of the box, it&#8217;s really easy to use a production-quality server in development mode. But when it comes time to move things off your local box and onto a real server in production mode, things aren&#8217;t so baked in. It&#8217;s more of a DIY situation.</p>
