<p>In case you ever tried to leave a comment here, you will have noticed that doing so took ages &#8212; statically building the pages simply took way too long. I have now enabled MovableType&#8217;s dynamic publishing support (selectively for those templates where I believe it makes sense). Let me know if you run into any problems (and feel free to try it out with this or any other post).</p>

<p>It also means that posting is now a lot more fun &#8212; while I had to wait for a minute or so in the past, it&#8217;s now a matter of seconds.</p>
