<p>Tomorrow evening, I'll give a talk on REST and JSR 311 (JAX-RS) at the <a href="http://www.jbug-munich.org/index.php/home">Munich JBoss User Group</a> - this time together with my colleague Serge Pagop, who will add <a href="http://www.jboss.org/resteasy/">RESTeasy</a>-specific aspects. Very much looking forward to it – I've come to enjoy these informal talks at least as much as those at larger conferences.</p>
