<p><a href="http://www.tallent.us/PermaLink.aspx?guid=b092e863-7822-4b91-865e-015cafe382e3">Richard Tallent</a> points to <a href="http://politicalcompass.org/" title="The Political Compass">The Political Compass</a>, where you can assess your own position in the political spectrum &#8230; interesting, although obviously targeted at U.S. citizens, it&#8217;s fun to see how it evaluates a European citizen&#8217;s opinion (I scored Economic Left/Right: -0.25 and Libertarian/Authoritarian: -5.44).</p>
