<p><a href="http://wanderingbarque.com/appfs/using_appfs.html">appfs</a> leverages <a href="http://fuse.sourceforge.net/">Fuse</a> (Filesystem in Userspace) and the Fuse Ruby binding, FuseFS, as well as the <a href="http://code.necronomicorp.com/trac/atom-tools">Atom-Tools</a> Ruby library by Brendan Taylor. appfs simply glues the two together.</p>
