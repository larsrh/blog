<p>A <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/critics/cinema/articles/060529crci_cinema">hilarious review</a> of The Da Vinci Code (the movie):</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The story of &#8220;The Da Vinci Code&#8221; goes like this. A dead  Frenchman is found laid out on the floor of the Louvre.  His final act was to carve a number of bloody marking  into his own flesh, indicating, to the expert eye, that he  was preparing to roll in fresh herbs and sear himself in  olive oil for three minutes on each side. This, however, is not the conclusion reached by Robert Langdon (Tom  Hanks), a professor of symbology at Harvard, who  happens to be in Paris. Questioned by Bezu Fache (Jean  Reno), the investigating policeman at the scene, Langdon  starts rabbiting about pentacles and pagans and God knows  what. But what does God know, exactly? And can He keep His mouth shut?</p>
