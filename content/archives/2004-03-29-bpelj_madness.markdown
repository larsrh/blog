<p>IBM and BEA have published a <a href="http://www-106.ibm.com/developerworks/webservices/library/ws-bpelj/">whitepaper</a>  about a combination of BPEL with Java, named BPELJ.</p>

<p>I fully agree with <a href="http://www.collaxa.com/radio/2004/03/24.jsp#a531"> Edwin Khodabakchian</a> that this is a totally bad idea. I have a hard time accepting XML for building programming language-like constructs, anyway; but actually combining an XML process language while requiring another one as well seems to be totally wrong.</p>
