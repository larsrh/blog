<p>Wise words from <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/untonet/~3/306875682/">DeWitt Clinton</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>My conclusion is that if you can produce valid xhtml, go for it. But in the end it doesn’t make much of a difference. In fact, I’m pretty certain that the web itself wouldn’t have succeeded if xhtml was required from the beginning, because a web that renders and displays documents is a much better web than one that throws validation errors all over the place.</p>
