<p><a href="http://www.markbaker.ca/2002/09/Blog/2006/02/20#2006-02-ws-interop-probs">Mark Baker</a> and <a href="http://www.1060.org/blogxter/entry?publicid=3AF543F66872BED84AE6F21471730EB5">Steve Loughran</a> write about the reasons for SOAP interop problems. My favorite quote comes from Steve:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The most poignant metric of interop problems is how Sun and Microsoft are so proud of collaborating so that their SOAP stacks will work together. Why don&#8217;t you see the same vendors getting together to demo Http client/server or Xml Parser interop? Because if you were that incompetent, people would notice.</p>
