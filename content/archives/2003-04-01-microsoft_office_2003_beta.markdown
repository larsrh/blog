<p>Finally the Office 2003 beta, including InfoPath, has arrived. InfoPath looks really, really interesting, although I'm sure that I'll be disappointed once I know more about its details - this seems to be the case with MS apps for nearly everytime. Anyway, I hope I'm wrong, since it would be very cool if it turned out to be the first document-oriented Web services standard client out there ...</p>
