<blockquote>
<p>Does your app leave little &#8220;pid&#8221; files around to indicate something is running with some OS process id? Or can your app actually start up and detect that some other process in the system is running? And begin communicating with it?</p>
<p>Can those various processes come and go, and yet the system continues to run, perhaps after healing itself?</p>
<p>That is *service* oriented and that seems to be more about messages and not so much about objects. We should have a &#8220;programmer&#8217;s holiday&#8221; where we all pause our current work and play with Erlang for a week. Not that we should all be using Erlang for everything, but we should all be *influenced* by Erlang for everything.</p>

<p>Maybe that&#8217;s not a bad idea at all.</p>
