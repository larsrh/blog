<p>I&#8217;m late in linking to all of this, but still: <a href="http://www.markbaker.ca/2002/09/Blog/2006/03/16#2006-03-http-minus">Mark Baker calls bullshit</a> on <a href="/blog/st/2006/03/15/wstransfer_wsenumeration_wseventing_submitted_to_w3c.html">WS-Transfer</a>, and <a href="http://www.loudthinking.com/arc/000575.html">quite</a> <a href="http://www.pocketsoap.com/weblog/2006/03/1606.html">a few</a> <a href="http://www.mnot.net/blog/2006/03/15/transfer">people</a> <a href="http://seanmcgrath.blogspot.com/archives/2006_03_12_seanmcgrath_archive.html#114251035292693038">join</a> him. Although I have the utmost respect for many of the spec&#8217;s authors, I can&#8217;t help but agree &#8212; I didn&#8217;t like WS-Transfer <a href="/blog/st/2004/09/21/wstransfer_porttype_huh.html">one and a half years ago</a>, and I still don&#8217;t see why I would not stick with plain HTTP in situations where I want to use a uniform API. And with regards to any of the experts, or even spec authors, actually rushing to defend their work, the silence is deafening.</p>

<p>But there is an easy way out &#8212; the WS-TransferToRESTfulHTTP binding, a spec so small that I can reprint it here in its entirety:</p>
