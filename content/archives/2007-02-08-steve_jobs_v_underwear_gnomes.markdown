<blockquote>
<p>It&#8217;s about time record execs pull their heads out of their asses, and, after the giant &#8216;schloORK&#8217; sound is done ringing in their ears, they start treating valued customers like they are valued and/or customers, instead of like a seething criminal class. Yes, there will always be people who steal music. So either offer the rest of us a compelling alternative to being one of them, or die the dinosaur&#8217;s death that you so richly deserve.</p>
