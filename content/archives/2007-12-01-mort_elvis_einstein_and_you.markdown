<p><a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/001004.html">Jeff Atwood</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Thus, if you read the article, you are most assuredly in the twenty percent category. The other eighty percent are not actively thinking about the craft of software development. They would never find that piece, much less read it. They simply don&#8217;t read programming blogs&#8212; other than as the result of web searches to find quick-fix answers to a specific problem they&#8217;re having. Nor have they read any of the books in my recommended reading list. The defining characteristic of the vast majority of these so-called &#8220;vocational&#8221; programmers is that they are unreachable. It doesn&#8217;t matter what you, I or anyone else writes here&#8212; they&#8217;ll never see it.</p>

<p>This is <em>so</em> true. </p>
