	  <p>I&#8217;ve written more than 2000 entries on this blog (2168, including this one, to be exact), but I don&#8217;t believe I&#8217;ve ever mentioned what I consider to be one of the best things about our company, <a href="/">innoQ</a> - our <em>events</em>. &#8220;innoQ Event&#8221; may sound a little strange in English (my guess is it almost qualifies as a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudo-Anglicism">pseudo-anglicism</a>), but when mixed into our standard German conversation, it&#8217;s perfectly OK.</p>

<p>Our events are actually company get-togethers; we assemble all of the technical staff from innoQ Germany and innoQ Switzerland, and spend two days together in some venue &#8212; typically a nice hotel with a decent conference room. During this time, we have technical talks, work together in small teams, exchange project information, discuss problems (and hopefully solutions) &#8230; all in all, a kind of small company-internal conference. Usually, we have something between 25 and 35 people, including guests &#8212; just the right size to enable lively discussions. The events are also the perfect occasion to talk about leading edge stuff, little-known scientific topics, or fun projects.</p>

<p>For a company of our size, doing this at this frequency &#8212; and assembling people from two countries &#8212; is pretty expensive. I don&#8217;t doubt for a second that it&#8217;s worth every single euro-cent, though.</p>
