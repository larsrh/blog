	  <p>I&#8217;ve grown tired of the problems with junk comments, false positives, and all the hassle involved in with handling this. My apologies if any of <em>your</em> comments failed to show up &#8212; MT reports they&#8217;ve been held for approval even if they have been identified as junk. </p>

<p>Essentially, I believe there are only two options that actually work: disable comments altogether, or use some <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captcha">CAPTCHA&trade; method</a>. I&#8217;ve decided to do the latter, so comments now require a preview first, and then a 4-digit code. I&#8217;ve used the <a href="http://plugins.movalog.com/scode/">SCode</a> plugin for Movable Type &#8212; all of the other Spam protection mechanisms built into MT never worked out for me (which makes me wonder why I don&#8217;t do what all the cool kids do and write my own blog software). </p>

<p>If you want to do me a favor, leave a comment and let me know if you run into any problems &#8212; via <a href="mailto:stefan.tilkov@innoq.com">email</a> if necessary.</p>

<p>Question 1: why must humans see the captcha?</p>

<p>You&#8217;re kidding, CAPTCHA is a trademark?  </p>

<p>I have to say that I&#8217;m very anti-CAPTCHA.  It seems to mainly deter everyone but spammers from commenting; I still get occasional blasts of a dozen or so spam comments.  I&#8217;m curious to see what your experience is like.</p>

<p>freedom comes at a cost: If people abuse their freedom to leave comments, others have to pay the price in form of hieroglyph-decipering, aka captcha. Makes me keep of commenting on many blogs, though&#8230; (but, naturally, not with Stefan :-)</p>

<p>Did you see a 4 digit code? Or a 6 digit code? It should be 4.</p>

<p>Gordon: I agree, and I don&#8217;t like CAPTCHAs. (It&#8217;s trademarked by Carnegie Mellon University, BTW). But I received <em>way</em> too many spams comments - sometimes about 200 a day. Absolutely intolerable. Maybe it&#8217;s because we&#8217;re using MovableType and this is a primary target?</p>

<p>Sam, I think I found the problem why you couldn&#8217;t post - there were some leftover 6-digit codes lying around in the file system. Things should work now.</p>

<p>Working on your other suggestions now &#8230;</p>
