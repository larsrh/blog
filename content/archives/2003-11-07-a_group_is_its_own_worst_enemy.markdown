<p><a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/">Joel Spolsky</a> points to <a href="http://www.shirky.com/writings/group_enemy.html" title="Shirky: A Group Is Its Own Worst Enemy">this brillant article</a> by Clay Shirky. One of its topics is that you can analyze a group by looking at it as a whole, or at the invidual members, but never both at once. Very true!</p>

<p>It seems to me you could make an analogy to music - you can listen to a piece of music as a whole, or you can follow one of the voices or instruments, but never both at the same time. Why is this important? It&#8217;s not, but it struck me as a nice metaphor ;-)</p>
