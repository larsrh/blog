<p>Sun&#8217;s Jonathan Schwartz <a href="http://news.com.com/Suns+Schwartz+guns+for+patent+glories/2100-1014_3-5390714.html?tag=nefd.top">has filed a patent application</a> for employee-based software licensing. What nonsense.</p>

<p>This whole patenting thing is becoming more and more ridiculous &#8212; my guess it&#8217;s that it&#8217;s just a matter of a few years before it collapses totally.</p>

<p>Patenting is like politics : a shame !</p>

<p>It&#8217;s a way for the system to controle inovation, free voices.
The good news is that with internet, companies like skype are able to break it.
They are the true revolutionaire of today ;)</p>
