<blockquote>
<p>Service-oriented architecture is one of the toughest initiatives to sell to upper management &#8211; but with CASEBUILDER&#8482; SOA you can do it. CASEBUILDER&#8482; SOA provides you with the verbiage you need to explain SOA to non-technical people and &#8220;sell&#8221; its long-term strategic benefits. It also shows you &#8211; in template form &#8211; a unique method for calculating the ROI an SOA initiative can deliver. You just plug in your numbers. Finally, CASEBUILDER&#8482; SOA includes a professionally designed PowerPoint template that has over 75% of the material you&#8217;ll need for your presentation.</p>
