I <a href="/blog/st/2003/04/29/native_xml_support_in_ecmascript.html">mentioned this</a> a while back, and thought it was cool, and still do; ultimately, though, I think what&#8217;s even better is if your language supports doing something like <a href="http://okmij.org/ftp/Scheme/SXML.html">this</a> even for next year&#8217;s cool technology.</p>
