<p><a href="http://vowe.net/about.php">vowe</a> is not someone you expect to post a hoax &#8212; so if it applies to you (i.e., if you&#8217;re running Windows), <a href="http://vowe.net/archives/006680.html">his advice is probably good</a>:</p>

<p>Stop reading. And run this command now:<br />
regsvr32.exe /u shimgvw.dll</p>
