<blockquote>
<p>A significant weakness of HTTP in my view is its dependence on the MIME standard for media type identification and on the related iana registry. This registry is a limited bottleneck that does not have the capacity to deal with the media type definition requirements of individual enterprises or domains.</p>

<p>I think this debate sometimes confuses two related problems - resource type identification and resource type definition/documentation.</p>

<p>People seem to want to use a single URI for both purposes. URIs are great for pointing to documentation/specification, but I think it&#8217;s problematic to use them for resource type identity.</p>
