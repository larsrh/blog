<p>In <a href="http://jooto.com/blog/index.php/2006/08/08/replacing-service-oriented-architecture-with-resource-oriented-architecture/" title="Replacing Service Oriented Architecture with Resource Oriented Architecture">this article</a>, Alex Bunardzic makes the case for resources instead of services. I like it, although I&#8217;m not sure it&#8217;ll be convincing to those who don&#8217;t already believe in the resource paradigm &#8230;</p>
