<p><a href="http://ws.apache.org/axis2/intro.html">This</a> sure sounds like the right way to go &#8230; </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Axis2 is an effort to re-design and totally re-implement both Axis/Java and (eventually) Axis/C++ on a new architecture. [&#8230;] Another driving force for Axis2 is to move away from RPC oriented Web services towards more document-oriented, message style asynchronous service interactions. [&#8230;] At the time of Axis1&#8217;s design, RPC-style, synchronous, request-response interactions were the order of the day for Web services. Today service interactions are much more message-oriented and exploit many different message exchange patterns. The Axis2 engine architecture is careful to not build in any assumptions of request-response patterns to ensure that it can be used easily to support arbitrary message exchange patterns.</p>
