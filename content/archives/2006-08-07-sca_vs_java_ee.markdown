<p>David Chappell (the one from David Chappell &#38; Associates, not the one from Sonic) considers SCA to be <a href="http://www.davidchappell.com/blog/2006/08/real-threat-to-java-ee">the real threat to Java EE</a>.</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t have an informed comment since I still haven&#8217;t really spent time with SCA &#8212; something I urgently need to change.</p>
