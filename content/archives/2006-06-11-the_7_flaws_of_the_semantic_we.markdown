<p>I&#8217;m still undecided as to my opinion about the Semantic Web &#8212; the number of people I respect who love it is roughly equal to that of those who hate it. In any case, Dan Zambonini&#8217;s <a href="http://www.oreillynet.com/xml/blog/2006/06/the_7_flaws_of_the_semantic_we.html">7 (f)laws of the Semantic Web</a> is interesting reading &#8230;</p>
