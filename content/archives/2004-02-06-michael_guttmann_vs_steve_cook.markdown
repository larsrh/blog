<p>Stefan, do you have a copy of Michael Guttmann&#8217;s response? Following the link in your comment today (15mar04) leads to BPT&#8217;s homepage &#8212; no occurrence of &#8220;Guttmann&#8221; there. Any info appreciated. Thanks.</p>

<p>Francesco</p>

<p>Francesco - sorry; it seems the link was broken (it contained an extra character). I believe it should work now.</p>
