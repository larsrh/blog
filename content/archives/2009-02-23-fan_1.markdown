<p>Yet another programming language on the JVM: <a href="http://www.fandev.org/">Fan</a>. And it <a href="http://www.fandev.org/doc/docIntro/WhyFan.html">doesn't seem too bad at all â€¦</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Do we really need another programming language? Well obviously we thought so, or we wouldn't have built Fan! Fan is designed as a practical programming language to make it easy and fun to get real work done. It is not an academic language to explore bleeding edge theories, but based on solid real world experience. During its design we set out to solve what we perceived were some real problems with Java and C#. Our background is heavily Java, but many of Java's problems are shared by C# and .NET also.</p>
