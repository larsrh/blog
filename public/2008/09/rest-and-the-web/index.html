<blockquote>
<p>All that wonderful chaos at global scale is why the Web is appealing, and why I think REST is simply a backdrop to that picture.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It's no secret that I'm a big fan of the REST approach, but of course it's neither holy nor applicable in every situation. Still, I believe that the Web, used in a RESTful way, is much more useful than it is when used unRESTfully. The reason is simply that Roy Fielding has managed to capture many of the Web's best attributes in his REST theory. Call it what you want, the uniform interface, hypermedia, links, standardized resource identifiers, stateless communication – these are all, in fact, pretty cool ideas.</p>

<p>Oh, and Jim, quit trying to avoid admitting that you've become a full member of the RESTafarian Church ;-)</p>
