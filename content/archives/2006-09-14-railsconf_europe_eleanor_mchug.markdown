<p>A slightly weird talk, but fun: Eleanor and her colleague Romek (can&#8217;t remember the last name) talked about using _why&#8217;s Camping to build a UI for a DNS packet sniffer. I had expected a little more detail about the differences between Camping and Rails, but it was definitely entertaining.</p>

<p>Glad you enjoyed the talk, the slides will soon be up on Skills Matter&#8217;s website. My partner in crime was Romek Szczesniak.</p>
