<blockquote>
<p>A <a href="http://github.com/ezmobius/nanite/tree/master/README">Nanite</a> installation is based around a "mapper exchange" with which Ruby daemons (called Nanite "agents") register. Nanite mappers (running in, say, Rails or Merb applications, or even command line apps) can then call the exchange and gain access to the functionality of the agents. The mapper exchange makes it possible for daemons / agents to start, stop and die while allowing the whole cluster to be self-healing.</p>
