	  <p>Mark <a href="http://www.markbaker.ca/2002/09/Blog/2005/03/01#deliciousdistobj.hughw__REST_and...uages">points to</a>, and agrees with, <a href="http://hughw.blogspot.com/2005/02/when-you-sit-down-to-write-description.html">a post by Hugh Winkler</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>When you sit down to write a description language for REST services (a IDL or WSDL for REST), you discover that doing so is unnecessary.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It seems to me that it&#8217;s not the REST part, but rather the RDF idea that would make service descriptions unnecessary. I can&#8217;t see why describing the schemas resource representations are expected to conform to &#8212; if such an assumption is made &#8212; would make no sense. On the contrary, REST + Relax NG + Schematron would seem a smart choice to me.</p>

<p>(Don&#8217;t get me wrong, though; I&#8217;ve recently started reading up on Semantic Web topics, and actually like the concepts a lot &#8212; this is likely going to be a topic of future posts.)</p>
