<p>Jim has <a href="http://jim.webber.name/2008/05/20/2f7966ac-29e8-4569-8645-6e85ba449898.aspx">a nice set of answers</a> to common REST questions/bogus claims -- some overlap with <a href="http://www.infoq.com/articles/tilkov-rest-doubts">my own list</a>, but good points:</p>

<ul>
<li>REST is simple.</li>
<li>REST won't work in my situation.</li>
<li>REST is all about CRUD.</li>
<li>You can't do pub/sub with REST.</li>
<li>Apart from UDDI, all the WS-* specs are new solutions to real problems.</li>
<li>HTTP just maps to a database.</li>
<li>If-Modified-Since is less accurate than and ETag and If-None-Matches.</li>
<li>You only need to know 5 HTTP response codes: 200 304, 400, 404, and 500.</li>
</ul>
