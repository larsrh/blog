<p>Even though I&#8217;m not a fan of WSDL, I like <a href="http://code.google.com/p/relax-ws/">this</a> very much:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>WSDL is a key technology for SOA, and yet creating and editing these files is about as much fun as straightening all the noodles in a bowl of spaghetti with a pair of tweezers.<br /><br /><a href="http://code.google.com/p/relax-ws/">Relax-ws</a> provides a simple, compact syntax for generating WSDL&#8217;s. It does this by extending RelaxNG Compact syntax with support for services, ports, operations, and messages.</p>
