<p><a href="http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/">Tim Bray</a> writes about <a href="http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2004/09/10/DRMprobs">the DRM Debacle</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Right now, we have the DMCA and its ill-begotten brethren; all foisted on the unsuspecting public by legislators in the pay of the music and movie industries. They were able to get away with this because most people&#8217;s lives have never been touched by this crappy, intrusive, intolerable technology. Eventually they will be, and despite the fact that Western democracies are mildly corrupt, they are still democracies, and the people will one way or another say &#8220;Make this stop!&#8221; and the legislators will. At which point, the doors will be opened for another explosion of innovation and business growth.</p>

<p>Let&#8217;s hope he is right.</p>
