<p><a href="http://www.iona.com/blogs/vinoski/archives/000233.html">Steve Vinoski</a> (correctly) questions the credibility of a poll that finds 1 out of 7 SOA projects failing. (Never mind whether that is way too many or far too few &#8230;) I decided to follow the links &#8212; and ended up on <a href="http://www.soapipeline.com/vote/051104_soasat.jhtml">this page</a> that allowed me to put in my own vote.</p>

<p>A voting page open to the Internet in general constitutes a &#8220;poll&#8221; that is worth talking about?</p>

<p>The only reasonable conclusion I can gather from this is that at least <a href="http://www.soa-pipeline.com/blog/archives/2005/11/soa_implementat.html">two</a> <a href="http://blogs.zdnet.com/service-oriented/?p=479?=rss&amp;tag=feed&amp;subj=zdblog">authors</a> in the chain write plain bullshit.</p>
