<p><a href="http://www.maddogsandmore.org/blog/pg/archives/000345.html" title="Phillip's Blog: Meeting Systinet Staff">Phillip writes about</a> our meeting with a bunch of people from <a href="http://www.systinet.com">Systinet</a>, and I agree completely - it was an excellent technical discussion, followed by a lively get-together in one of Prague's excellent pubs. I have to admit that the Czech Republic is the only real competitor to Germany when it comes to beer.<br />
And no, Phillip, you better not tell any more details, since not even <a href="http://www.radovanjanecek.net/blog">Radovan</a> does ;-)</p>
