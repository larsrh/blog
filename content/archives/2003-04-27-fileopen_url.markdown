<p>SharpReader can do an <a href="http://www.hutteman.com/weblog/2003/04/27.html#000076" title="OPML import from a URL">OPML import from a URL</a>, due to the .NET framework. What's great is that this works with any tool that uses the standard FileOpen dialog, such as UltraEdit - even though it's a standard Windows app. Very cool.</p>
