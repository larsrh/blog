<p><a href="http://ws.apache.org/commons/axiom" title="Apache Axiom">Apache Axiom</a>, the object model that sits in                     <a href="http://ws.apache.org/axis2/">Axis 2</a>&#8217;s core, has been released. I wasn&#8217;t aware that it could be used independently of Axis, definitely worth a look if only for its <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xop10/">XOP</a>/<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/soap12-mtom/">MTOM</a> support.</p>

<p><em>Update:</em> Elliotte Rusty Harold has <a href="http://cafeconleche.org/oldnews/news2006May3.html">some comments</a>:</p>

<p>There are some interesting new ideas here, that should be explored further. However, as a library it&#8217;s clearly unsuitable for production use.</p>
