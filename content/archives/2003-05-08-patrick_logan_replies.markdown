<p><a href="http://patricklogan.blogspot.com/2003_05_04_patricklogan_archive.html#200259456" title="Making it stick.">Patrick Logan</a> replies, and I'm still puzzled as to the ways to blogosphere seems to work. Especially since his blog doesn't seem to support trackbacks, I wonder how he found about my post at all. I wonder if all Blogger-run weblogs have the same problems - e.g. I had to do a 'view source' on the HTML version to find out which URI to link to for a specific post. And in contrast to all other RSS feeds I'm subscribed to with Syndirella, Patrick's blog is the only one where the RSS does not include a link to the post ... So Patrick, in case your picking up this one as well: You content is great, but your blog infrastructure sucks ;-)</p>
