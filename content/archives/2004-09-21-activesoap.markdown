<blockquote>
<p><a href="http://activesoap.codehaus.org/">ActiveSOAP</a> is a high performance, lightweight &#38; easily embeddable, StAX based SOAP framework for document centric Web Services and implementing SOAP intermediaries.</p>

<p>ActiveSOAP uses pure StAX to implement the SOAP protocol, parsing and processing the SOAP headers, roles &#38; relaying using pure StAX for high performance which is particularly useful when performance is critical or when you are implementing a SOAP router, load balancer or intermediary.</p>
