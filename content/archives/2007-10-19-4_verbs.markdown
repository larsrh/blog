<p><a href="http://www.dehora.net/journal/2007/10/my_bowlegged_master.html">Bill de h&#211;ra</a> on HTTP methods:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I&#8217;d encourage anyone not to make the assumption that POST is the prime method and hence the most powerful, when in fact it&#8217;s merely the least meaningful (and likely hiding a design flaw around resource naming) . It&#8217;s what you use when the others don&#8217;t fit the problem. It&#8217;s not like we encourage programmers to call all their methods &#8220;execute&#8221;.</p>

<p>+1. Of course using GET <em>and</em> POST is better than using GET <em>or</em> POST only (I have a hard time figuring out whether the POX-style all-GET or the WS-style all-POST way is worse, BTW), but of course relying on more shared semantics and the idempotency guarantees of PUT and DELETE is even better. I would claim that having a few more (ideally idempotent) verbs would be even better (although the cost of introducing them is probably prohibitive).</p>

<p>all-POST is better than having even one non-safe operation implemented as GET.</p>

<p>Although one could argue that in the all-GET scenario, at least some &#8220;calls&#8221; add meaningful URIs to the Web &#8230;</p>

<p>I&#8217;d agree with Sam, but having real issues with POST and Same Origin Policy in browsers, widgets and sites like iGoogle. In many cases injecting a script tag into the DOM is the best way to make phones rings, and that sucks.</p>
