<blockquote>
<p>Consider: What if ParcPlace had patented the idea of a language runtime/VM back in the 80s, and then acted like Verizon has against Vonage? Would the software industry be a better place now? As much of a Smalltalk advocate as I am, I&#8217;m going to say no. Software patents should be eliminated - they help no one.</p>
