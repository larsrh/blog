	  <p><a href="http://diveintomark.org/archives/2008/01/17/of-canaries-and-coal-mines">Mark Pilgrim</a> is just great:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There are not hordes of fed-up consumers rejecting Apple’s vision of cryptographic lock-in. There are not mass graves where people ceremoniously dump their crippled, non-general-purpose computing devices. Outside of Planet Debian and my own personal echo chamber, nobody gives a shit about Freedom 0.<br />You knew this, of course, but I just wanted to let you know that I knew, too.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Just to ensure nobody accuses me of being an Apple fanboy: Apple is just as &#8220;evil&#8221; as Microsoft, or Google, or any other large corporation. For me personally, it&#8217;s just that it isn&#8217;t evil enough yet to outweigh the advantages.</p>

<p>Hmm, are large corporations evil for being large corporations, or are they evil for what they <em>do</em>?</p>
