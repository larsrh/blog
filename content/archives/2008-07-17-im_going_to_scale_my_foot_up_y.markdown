<p>The best quote on scalability I&#8217;ve seen all year long comes from <a href="http://teddziuba.com/2008/04/im-going-to-scale-my-foot-up-y.html">Ted Dziuba</a>, via <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/001152.html">Jeff Atwood</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Scalability is not your problem, getting people to give a shit is.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Be sure to read <a href="http://teddziuba.com/2008/04/im-going-to-scale-my-foot-up-y.html">the whole thing</a>.</p>
