<p>My little experiment with moving from Windows to Linux+VMware is working pretty nicely &mdash; I know have Linux running, as well as VMware, as well as a Win2K partition inside of it. My WLAN PC Card was recognized, the screen resolution and display performance is excellent, networking works as desired ... well, almost: There is a problem left with the VMware/Windows installation not getting to set its name server address automatically, but so what.<br />
Installaing WIndows as a guest operating system took far longer than installing and configuring the Linux host OK, but that was mostly due to some strange problems with VMware that I only could circumvent by leaving the installation routine alone, i.e. not using the machine for anything else during that period. But since VMware, IMHO, is pure black magic anyway, I can live with this minor nuisance.</p>

<p>Du bist vermutlich mal wieder absolut geblendet und für Kritik gegenüber deinem minderwertigen System nicht offen ;-)</p>

<p>Mal sehen, wie lange dich deine Lösung wirklich begeistert.</p>
