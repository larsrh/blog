<p><a href="http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/">Tim Bray</a> takes a look at <a href="http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2005/08/27/Ruby">Ruby</a>; I agree with almost everything he writes, even though his statement about Ruby&#8217;s threading support echoes parts of <a href="http://creativekarma.com/more.php?id=260_0_1_0_M">Doug Pardee&#8217;s rant</a> from a while back. Ruby is certainly not perfect, but the amount of attention it currently gets is simply amazing.</p>
