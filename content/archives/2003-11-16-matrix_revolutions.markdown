<p>After some time of severe, non-weblogging-suitable work, it&#8217;s time to write about a few things &#8230; <strong>Matrix Revolutions</strong> being the easiest to do, since <a href="http://www.dynamicobjects.com/d2r/">Diego</a> has summed it up so greatly <a href="http://www.dynamicobjects.com/d2r/archives/002415.html">here</a> and <a href="http://www.dynamicobjects.com/d2r/archives/002413.html">here</a>.
My personal summary: Although I had set my expectations pretty low up front, even those were disappointed. No, I did not like it very much. Sorry, <a href="http://radovanjanecek.net/blog/">Radovan</a> ;-)</p>
