<p>Mike Champion, formerly Software AG, now Microsoft, <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/mikechampion">has a blog</a> &#8212; subscribed. All of his posts are worth linking to, so I&#8217;ll pick an off-topic issue from <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/mikechampion/archive/2005/01/31/364136.aspx">one of them</a>, a pointer to Orwell&#8217;s classical <a href="http://www.resort.com/%7Eprime8/Orwell/patee.html">Politics and the English Language</a> with this famous set of rules for writing, written almost 60 years ago:</p>

<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>Never use a metaphor, simile, or other figure of speech which you are used to seeing in print.</li>
<li>Never us a long word where a short one will do.</li>
<li>If it is possible to cut a word out, always cut it out.</li>
<li>Never use the passive where you can use the active.</li>
<li>Never use a foreign phrase, a scientific word, or a jargon word if you can think of an everyday English equivalent.</li>
<li>Break any of these rules sooner than say anything outright barbarous.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
