<blockquote>
<p>But the real point, the one we all made to each other, was this: Can you imagine if Robin Trower came along today? He couldn&#8217;t even get a record deal. It&#8217;s hard to believe today that only 30 years ago there was a market for guys who were just flat-out virtuoso musicians, guys who could fill a stadium with people who just came to hear some amazing dude play his instrument. No back-up dancers, no flashing video screens, no lip-synching. Just three guys on a stage. And people would sit there and listen. We all agreed that the music business sucks today. Then we all felt sad. Then we all felt old.</p>
