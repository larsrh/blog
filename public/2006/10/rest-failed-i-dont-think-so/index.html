	<section>
	  <p><a href="http://cafe.elharo.com/web/why-rest-failed/">Elliotte Rusty Harold</a> believes REST has failed because browsers don&#8217;t support (and standards don&#8217;t require them to support) PUT and DELETE. This is a very interesting post, especially because there is little doubt that Elliotte actually &#8220;gets&#8221; REST; his opinion is not based on plain misunderstanding. The one thing he ignores, though, is that REST principles are perfectly usable for app-to-app communication, where all verbs can be used without a problem.</p>
