<p>My colleague Phillip <a href="/blog/pg/archives/002586.html">points out correctly</a> that technical superiority is one thing, and tool support is another. I have to admit I was happy with Emacs and <a href="http://www.thaiopensource.com/nxml-mode/">nXML mode</a>, but I understand that not many people share my liking for this environment.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m an nXML (and rng-mode) junkie, too, but for the less text-loving folks, OxygenXML has good RELAX tooling, including a graphical overview that&#8217;s more or less equivalent to the familiar graphical representation of XML Schema.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m using Emacs 21.4 with Mule-UCS, unfortunally, nxml mode doesn&#8217;t work with mule. It&#8217;s a pity.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ll be waiting for Emacs 22 release, to start using nxml mode.</p>

<p>From about twenty feet RNC looks like CSS. Where are all the CSS toolkits?</p>
