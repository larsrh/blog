<p><a href="/blog/st/2005/10/18/things_you_can_do_with_an_xml_message.html#comments">Comments</a> to Wednesday&#8217;s entry about <a href="/blog/st/2005/10/18/things_you_can_do_with_an_xml_message.html">XML messaging</a> show not everybody agrees. I remain convinced that if you don&#8217;t derive any additional value from using XML, if it simply remains an implementation detail, you&#8217;re better off using something else. In some ways, this is similar to using HTTP as a mere transport for SOAP &#8212; while it&#8217;s possible to use HTTP this way, you might just as well be doing SOAP over TCP directly.</p>
