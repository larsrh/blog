<p>For some reason that I can&#8217;t remember very clearly, I couldn&#8217;t resist trying out Boot Camp &#8212; and promptly ended up fucking up my system so thoroughly that I could no longer boot OS X :-( Ironically enough, Windows still started up nicely &#8230; but in the meantime, <a href="http://www.parallels.com/">Parallels</a> has released a beta of their virtualization solution for OS X on Intel, and I can happily report that it works like a charm:</p>

<p><a href="/blog/st/screenshot-parallels.png" onclick="window.open('/blog/st/screenshot-parallels.png','popup','width=1440,height=900,scrollbars=no,resizable=yes,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=yes,left=0,top=0');return false"><img src="/blog/st/screenshot-parallels-tm.jpg" border="0" vspace="4" height="300" hspace="4" alt="Screenshot-Parallels" width="480" /></a></p>

<p>I&#8217;m not yet sure about the performance, but without a doubt it&#8217;s significantly faster than Virtual PC ever was. I&#8217;ll report back once I have installed some applications &#8230;</p>

<p>In any case, I have no doubts either this, VMware&#8217;s or possibly a solution by Apple itself will ultimately turn an Intel Mac into the most useful machine one can buy.</p>
