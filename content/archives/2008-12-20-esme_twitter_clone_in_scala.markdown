<p>Now in the Apache Incubator:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><a href="http://incubator.apache.org/esme/">Enterprise Social Messaging Experiment (ESME)</a> is a secure and highly scalable microsharing and micromessaging platform that allows people to discover and meet one another and get controlled access to other sources of information, all in a business process context.<br />The ESME server is written in Scala and uses the Lift web framework to produce a browser-based user interface and also to expose a REST API.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>Update</em>: As <a href="http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/rest-discuss/message/11862">Bill de h√ìra points out</a>, the usage of "REST" in conjunction with <a href="http://code.google.com/p/esmeproject/wiki/REST_API_Documantation">this API</a> is a sad joke. </p>
