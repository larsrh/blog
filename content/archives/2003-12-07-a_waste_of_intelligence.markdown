<p><a href="http://www.gotdotnet.com/team/dbox/default.aspx?key=2003-12-04T09:17:42Z">Don Box points</a> to a <a href="http://blogs.gotdotnet.com/slippman/" title="Programming Visual C  ">Programming Visual C++</a> blog. Obviously, this is written by somebody who knows his stuff.</p>

<p>I still can&#8217;t help but wander, though, why anybody in their right minds would care about this. I mean &mdash; what exactly is the point of using a C++ dialect that is non-portable? It&#8217;s not as if C++ is an easy language to learn, and unless you need the performance or the portability or already know it, you&#8217;d be better of switching to Java or C#, depending on your preferences.</p>
