<p>I just thought that it might be a good time to figure out how all of this trackback stuff really works, and navigated to the movabletype web site - and bingo: I immediately found <a href="http://www.sixapart.com/log/2003/03/a_beginners_gui.shtml" title="Six Log: A Beginner's Guide to TrackBack">Six Log: A Beginner's Guide to TrackBack</a>. Excellent explanation, and hopefully this will work the way I expect (after  reconfiguring my weblog to enable trackback-related stuff by default).</p>
