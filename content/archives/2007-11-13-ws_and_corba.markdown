<blockquote>
<p>WS-* is where CORBA was circa 1997: it will be used to implement some good systems, but there will also be some high profile failures. A number of the specs will likely never be adopted by the mainstream (see WS-CDL, WS-Eventing), though some will definitely improve some ridiculous vendor interoperability disputes (e.g. WS-TX, WS-RM). Plenty of pundits (now bloggers) sing of its imminent triumph (channelling Orfali, Harkey and Edwards), but overall, the framework will not help solve the problem that was used to sell its adoption in the first place: increased agility, reuse, and visibility in IT. I think many WS-* tools actively <em>hinder</em> an SOA architect from achieving these goals.</p>
