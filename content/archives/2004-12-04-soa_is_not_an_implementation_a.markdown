<p><a href="http://schneider.blogspot.com/archives/2004_11_28_schneider_archive.html#110200307434626045">Interesting stuff</a> from <a href="http://schneider.blogspot.com/">Jeff Schneider</a>, and a common theme occurring in more and more discussions with customers and partners: it seems that illusions about a standardized development environment &#8212; standardized implementation frameworks &#8212; are becoming more and more irrelevant. If an SOA has some sort of a definition, it&#8217;s that implementations don&#8217;t matter. As I <a href="/blog/st/2004/04/22/soa_is_not_about_products.html">wrote before</a>, SOA is not about implementation or products, but about their overall interaction &#8212; abstract as hell, but useful exactly because of that.</p>
