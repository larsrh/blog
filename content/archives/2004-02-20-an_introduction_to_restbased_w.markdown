<p>Roger Costello has written an <a href="http://www.xfront.com/REST-Web-Services.html">excellent introduction</a> to building Web services in a RESTful way. I wish he had gone into more detail regarding the way you describe REST services with WSDL; other than that, it&#8217;s very easy to understand and highly recommended.</p>
