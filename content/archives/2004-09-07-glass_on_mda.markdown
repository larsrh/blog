<p>While googling for something else, I stumbled across a <a href="http://www.mel.nist.gov/div826/msid/sima/ebsc/files/soa_glass.pdf">slide deck on SOA</a> by <a href="http://grahamglass.blogs.com/main/">Graham Glass</a>, which includes these interesting opinions (slide 18):</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>Beyond SOA</em>
* The next big thing will be MDA (Model Driven Architectures)
* This layers nicely on top of an SOA
* MDA captures most of a system at a high level
* MDA implementations will execute the metadata directly
* MDA is the natural evolution of computer programming</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Needless to say, I don't have much to disagree with here :-)</p>
