<p>Via <a href="http://weblogs.cs.cornell.edu/AllThingsDistributed/archives/000098.html" title="All Things Distributed: Day two at MSF">Werner Vogel</a>,
I came across <a href="http://www.research.microsoft.com/~emeijer/Papers/XS.pdf">this paper about X#</a>,
a new programming language for the CLR.</p>
<p>The basic idea is similar to the one in ECMAScript XML extensions: Turn
XML (as well as, in case of X#, SQL) data into first class citizens in the programming language, like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>
Table t =
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;Name&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;HP&lt;/th&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
{pokemon}
&lt;/table&gt;;
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>In this case, the literal XML data is even strongly typed (it has type Table), which is an interesting notion.</p>
