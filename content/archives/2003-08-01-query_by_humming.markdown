<p>Via <a href="http://www.musicline.de/de/melodiesuche/" title="musicline.de - Die ganze Musik im Internet">this site (in German)</a>, you can look for that song you don't know the title of by simply humming 15 seconds of it. I tried it out, and it even works - very, very cool. Some information in English available <a href="http://www.germany-info.org/relaunch/education/new/edu_mp3_format.html">here</a>.</p>
