<p>From <a href="http://searchwebservices.techtarget.com/originalContent/0,289142,sid26_gci1250029,00.html?track=sy80">SCA and SDO become SOA essentials for banking system</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Isaacson suggested that without SCA, the system wouldn&#8217;t be able to efficiently use the hardware resources including multi-core processors to handle the loads from bank customers with thousands of accounts receivable (AR) transactions. Without SDO the planned system wouldn&#8217;t be able to efficiently handle the multiple data formats banks and their customers would be using.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yeah, right.</p>
