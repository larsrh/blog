<p>Gernot Starke writes about <a href="http://it-and-more.blogspot.com/2007/11/sh-happens-therefore-everybody-needs.html">his backup strategy</a> &#8212; pretty neat. I second the recommendation for <a href="http://www.shirt-pocket.com/SuperDuper/SuperDuperDescription.html">SuperDuper</a>: Even though it&#8217;s only a front-end to <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/Darwin/Reference/ManPages/man1/ditto.1.html">ditto</a>, it incorporates useful profiles, an incremental mode and has Apple&#8217;s recommended set of directories and files built in. Apart from this, my setup is similar - although I rely on a lot of accidental redundancy: I have quite a few Macs at home that share part of their data, I use a .Mac iDisk for the files in my working set, I use multiple Subversion servers &#8230;</p>
