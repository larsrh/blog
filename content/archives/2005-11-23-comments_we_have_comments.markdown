<p>Just a quick note to point out that the most interesting stuff on this blog is happening in the comments, e.g. <a href="/blog/st/2005/11/04/10_statements_about_soa.html#comments">here</a> (on the 10 SOA statements) or <a href="/blog/st/2005/11/21/binary_xml_idiocy.html#comments">here</a> (with regards to Binary XML) or <a href="/blog/st/2005/11/17/your_missioncritical_data_may_not_be_where_you_think_it_is.html#comments">here</a> (with a novel approach on app development related to Excel). Writing blog posts is nice; being aware that there&#8217;s someone out there who actually reads them is even nicer :-)</p>

<p>I wonder what&#8217;s the best way to make sure the comments get the attention they deserve &#8212; should I put a list of recent comments on the home page, or create a comment feed, or update the feed items for the entries when comments are added?</p>

<p>Comment feed, please: having posts become new again for no clear reason is just annoying and frustrating.</p>
