<p>The best part of SOAP has to be the orthogonal header mechanism. The worst part has to be how today&#8217;s stacks try and map the message to and from native classes, hiding the message from the caller. </p>

<p>(Just for the record, though: I do actually disagree with Steve&#8217;s assertion that you don&#8217;t need WS-Security (or something conceptually similar) with REST, and can just replace it with HTTPS. And I also believe there is nothing worse than XML-RPC.)</p>
