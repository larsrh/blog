<p><a href="http://xforms.org/xmltoday/content/twitter-publishing-xproc-and-restful-web-services">Kurt Cagle</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In order to explore the potential of the Twitter XML data, I decided to put together a RESTful data application built around an XML database (eXist in this case, though others could have been used) that would illustrate both how to use the Twitter API and, as importantly, how to make such an API work using virtual collections.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Kurt uses XQuery and <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xproc/">XProc</a> to build an application on top of the eXist database. The code seems pretty ugly to me, but the reason is quite probably my unfamiliarity with XQuery. It would be interesting to see the same application implemented with other languages â€¦</p>
