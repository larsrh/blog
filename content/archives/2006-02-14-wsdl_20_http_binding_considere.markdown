<blockquote>
<p>Section six may very well be still-born; there are few (if any?) <br />
implementations, and already there are several Web-specific <br />
description format proposals available (many authored by WG <br />
participants themselves!). However, it still concerns me, because I <br />
have seen a few instances where well-meaning architects reference it, <br />
assuming that a W3C Recommendation-to-be is of high quality and will <br />
be widely implemented.</p>
