<p>So then, I present to you <a href="http://jruby-extras.rubyforge.org/svn/trunk/java_inline/lib/java_inline.rb">java_inline, a RubyInline builder for JRuby</a>!</p>

<p>It&#8217;s probably a lot less useful than its <a href="http://www.zenspider.com/ZSS/Products/RubyInline/">C ancestor</a> &#8212; I can&#8217;t really think of a good reason why you&#8217;d embed your Java code inline instead of putting it into a separate Java source file. But there&#8217;s little doubt that this is <em>very</em> cool.</p>
