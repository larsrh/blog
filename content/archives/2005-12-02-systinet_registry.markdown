<p>An <a href="http://www.computerwoche.de/index.cfm?pid=336&amp;pk=3038&amp;opv=tb">article about Systinet Registry 6.0</a>, strangely enough found in a German magazine &#8212; you may have good reasons for not wanting to use UDDI, but if you want to, there&#8217;s simply no way around this particular implementation.</p>
