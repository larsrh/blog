<p><a href="http://apsblog.burtongroup.com/2007/11/why-microsoft-l.html" title="Application Platform Strategies Blog: Why Microsoft Loves Google's Android">Richard Monson-Haefel thinks</a> Microsoft benefits most from Google&#8217;s Android:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Java&#8217;s greatest strength today is uniformity and ubiquity. Take away uniformity and you end up with many different kinds of Java and so there is no real ubiquity. Take away ubiquity and there is very little incentive to choose the Java platform over other options like Microsoft .NET. In fact, Microsoft .NET starts looking a lot more attractive because it is consistently implemented; not Balkanized. If .NET is just as powerful as Java, why choose a solution such as Java that is inconsistently implemented across vendors?  The strongest marketing asset that Java has today, &#8220;write once, run anywhere&#8221; standardization, is effectively lost.</p>
