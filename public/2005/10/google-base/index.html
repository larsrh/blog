<p>the best summary i can find for this (if correct), is that its a flickr for anything. but it appears that they are offering you the ability to submit typed data, i.e. real estate listings, etc (they provide forms asking square footage, number of bathrooms, etc).</p>

<p>so its a raw storage mechanism with typed data fields being rolled out on a needs basis or as the market demands.</p>

<p>i am not sure how this makes money, and it will certainly cost a lot of money to run, but it appears to be an powerful platform.</p>
