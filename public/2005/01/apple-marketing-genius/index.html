	  <p>Of all the comments I&#8217;ve read about Apple&#8217;s new <a href="http://www.apple.com/ipodshuffle/">iPod shuffle</a>, I like <a href="http://bitworking.org/news/The_Apple_iPod_shuffle">Joe Gregorio&#8217;s</a> best:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Apple&#8217;s marketing is breathtaking. They start with a perfectly good MP3 player, rip out the display so you have no idea which song is playing, lock the thing into permanent shuffle mode and call it a feature. Actually, they go even further and make it the primary selling point, naming it &#8216;shuffle&#8217; and topping it off with the tag-line &#8216;Enjoy uncertainty.&#8217; You just have to admire their skill.</p>

<p>Actually, the shuffle can be switched into linear play mode (&#8220;Play in Order&#8221; mode).  Reality is that most people I know who own MP3 players either listen to playlists of diffferent artists in order, or in shuffle mode.  There&#8217;s not a ton of difference except the order in which you hear them &#8212; and that partly makes the experience &#8220;fresh&#8221; every time.</p>

<p>Still, it&#8217;s clearly a &#8220;damaged goods&#8221; strategy.  Apple gets the benefit of capitalizing on its potent brand and design strength to grow share in the low-end of the market, while the extremely basic and limited feature set ensures it won&#8217;t cannibalize its high-end sales.</p>

<p>Will it work?  Well, Creative&#8217;s MuVo doesn&#8217;t have a display either.  And the cost savings on the screen enables Apple to offer more room for music.  Which do kids value more?  Probably the space for music.  At $99 for 512 MB, I think that&#8217;s pretty close to class leading value on a capacity basis.</p>

<p>By the way, check out the picture of the guy biting into an Apple at the front page of iRiver&#8217;s web site.  It&#8217;s pretty funny.</p>

<p>Full disclosure: I don&#8217;t own any Apple products.</p>
