<p>So, I got myself one of these nice little Apple devices &#8230; only to find out that my primary reason for buying it, being able to synchronize with multiple Macs in my house, <a href="http://docs.info.apple.com/article.html?artnum=305270">is not supported</a>. There&#8217;s absolutely zero logical reasons for this, the only explanation is that someone at Apple must have felt that customers would miss something if a device does not piss them off due to some DRM-related restriction.</p>
