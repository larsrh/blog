	  <p>As <a href="http://www.1060.org/blogxter/entry?publicid=9724B6F6ECB7FE09A0524105B09DB4E7">Steve Loughran has written</a>, I&#8217;m becoming involved in his and Edmund
Smith&#8217;s effort to create Alpine, an XML-centric SOAP stack. Currently,
there is no infrastructure such as a Wiki or mailing in place yet. But
since Alpine is intended to be a very open project, I will simply outline
some of my own ideas here. As this is my blog, not an official project
site of any sort, what I write here is intended as input to a
discussion.</p>

<p>If you haven&#8217;t done so already, you should read <a href="http://www.hpl.hp.com/techreports/2005/HPL-2005-83.pdf">the excellent paper</a>
that officially started this thing (although Steve sent me a very
early Alpine doc back in September). If you&#8217;ve read my criticism of <a href="/blog/st/2005/05/18/rpcstyle_web_services.html">RPC-style Web services</a> recently, or if you search my blog for <a href="http://www.innoq.org/movabletype/mt-search.cgi?IncludeBlogs=1&amp;search=serialization&amp;Template=blog">serialization</a> or older posts like <a href="/blog/st/2004/06/16/objects_and_documentcentric_xml.html">this</a>, or even <a href="http://www.neward.net/ted/weblog/index.jsp?date=20040609#1086782396123">this older discussion with Ted Neward</a>, you won&#8217;t be surprised that I agree with most of it.</p>

<p>One part of the paper outlines a set of
design goals for Alpine:</p>

<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>Stay in the XML space as much as possible. </li>
<li>Take advantage of as much leading edge infrastructure
as we can. </li>
<li>Adopt the the handler chain pattern of Axis/JAX-RPC. </li>
<li>Target SOAP 1.2 (POST only, WS-I Basic Profile 1.1) </li>
<li>Document/literal mssages only, not RPC/encoded. </li>
<li>Support XSD and Relax NG schemas. </li>
<li>Run server-side, client-side, and as an intermediary. </li>
<li>No support for JAX-RPC or JAX-M/SAAJ APIs. </li>
<li>Configurable procedurally, through the Java Manage-
ment API (JMX). </li>
<li>Permit dynamic handler chain configuration during mes-
sage processing. </li>
<li>One supported parser. </li>
<li>Run on Java 1.5 and later. </li>
<li>No provision of side features such as a built in HTTP
server, or a declarative configuration mechanism. These
are delegated to other products. </li>
</ol>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#8217;ll review some of these in turn and try to provide some elaboration and personal opinion.</p>

<h3>Stay in the XML space as much as possible</h3>

<p>This is the number 1 design goal, as it is the major difference between Alpine and other, JAX-RPC based stacks. (In the elaborate words of Chris Ferris: <a href="http://webpages.charter.net/chrisfer/2005/05/squarepeg-roundhole.html">SquarePeg RoundHole</a>.) It&#8217;s also what I find the most attractive aspect about the whole idea. Preliminary discussions involved Elliotte Rusty Harold&#8217;s XOM as one of the possible XML APIs. As far as I can tell, XOM would be a good choice. I&#8217;m unsure about whether a pull parsing, push parsing (like SAX) or tree-based API, or all or only two of them, is the most pragmatic choice. It&#8217;s obviously not easy to switch from one to the other later on, so this needs to be decided early on. </p>

<h3>Take advantage of as much leading edge infrastructure as we can</h3>

<p>Not much comment here, except that I would like the project to avoid adding a gazillion JARs as a dependency. </p>

<h3>Adopt the the handler chain pattern of Axis/JAX-RPC</h3>

<p>The handler chain pattern is a common design element in CORBA ORBs,
JAX-RPC, as well as commercial implementations such as the one from
Systinet, so I&#8217;ll take this as a natural approach. One interesting are
is to find out how similar the processing model of handlers or
interceptors within the stack is to the processing model itself -
i.e. whether the handling of a message by multiple processors can be
local or distributed without a change to the programming model.</p>

<h3>Target SOAP 1.2 (POST only, WS-I Basic Profile 1.1)</h3>

<p>I think the SOAP 1.2 GET binding should definitely be supported &#8212; my only disagreement. If SOAP 1.1 is easy to add, I&#8217;d vote for doing it; I&#8217;m OK with primarly targeting 1.2, though. (WS-I BP 1.1 still relies on SOAP 1.1, BTW; WS-I profile compliance will obviously have to be postponed to one of the next versions.) </p>

<h3>Document/literal mssages only, not RPC/encoded</h3>

<p>RPC/encoded is a dead horse, so there&#8217;s no point in riding it. I believe the same is true about RPC/literal, still, WS-I BP compliance might require it. </p>

<h3>Support XSD and Relax NG schemas</h3>

<p>I think whether to validate and what schema language to use should be configurable. I see Schematron as a great additional candidate. I don&#8217;t see any need to make Alpine depend on WSDL or any other description format.</p>

<h3>Run server-side, client-side, and as an intermediary</h3>

<p>The ability to program intermediaries is in my view essential; it&#8217;s also a use case where the flexibility of having direct access to the SOAP message is required.</p>

<h3>No support for JAX-RPC or JAX-M/SAAJ APIs</h3>

<p>I don&#8217;t think support for JAXM or SAAJ as something that is necessarily bad. In my interpretation, it would be better to phrase this statement differently &#8212; support for JAXM or SAAJ is simply not a design goal.</p>
