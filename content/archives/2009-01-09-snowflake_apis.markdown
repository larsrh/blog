<p><a href="http://www.dehora.net/journal/2009/01/09/snowflake-apis/">Bill de h√ìra</a> has put up an excellent post:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Speculation: for Data APIs in 2009 there will be two developments and one debate.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The two developments (or rather ideas) Bill talks about are putting links into API data and standardisation of feed metadata; he predicts the debate will be around the use of custom data formats.</p>

<p>The data format issue <a href="http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/rest-discuss/message/11734">has been debated quite a bit</a> in the REST community recently. My guess is that we'll see more and more standardization of individual fragments than complete formats. Bill mentions <a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc5005.txt">RFC 5005</a>, which is an excellent example of this: although it refers to Atom, the elements it defines can be used within any XML format.</p>
