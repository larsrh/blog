<p><a href="http://fuzzypanic.blogspot.com/2007/05/ahem-where-are-jinijavaspaces-bits.html">Fuzzy</a> about JavaSpaces:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>What gives? Does Sun want this to happen or do they want it to die? I just don&#8217;t understand. I mean to offense - I&#8217;m new. But the current state of the community makes it very hard to want to invest in this technology - no matter how much potential it has.</p>

<p>Very true &#8212; JavaSpaces is exceptionally cool technology, but for some reason it could just as well be dead if you consider its market acceptance.</p>

<p>Hi, this thread is old and it still seems to be the same situation with Sun&#8217;s investment in JavaSpaces.
What about GigaSpaces? It sounds very promising to me.
Which experiences did your company make, as you are a partner of GigaSpaces?</p>
