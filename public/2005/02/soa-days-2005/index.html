	  <p>Deutsche Post, formerly &#8220;only&#8221; the German postal service, now one of the world&#8217;s largest logistics companies and owners of DHL, hosted a <a href="http://www.soai.org/SOA-Days/Main.htm">2-day conference</a> in Bonn these past two days. The conference has left me with mixed feelings &#8212; here, as well as at a number of other events I visited in the past year, there were a lot of talks that could just as easily have been given 3 or 5 years ago, just with the major buzzword (component, EAI) replaced by SOA. Still, there were some very good talks; and the presentation of Deutsche Post&#8217;s own SOA was very well received. </p>

<p>For me, a personal highlight was being able to talk to Sun&#8217;s Mark Hapner after his talk about Java Business Integration (<a href="http://www.jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=208">JBI, JSR 208</a>). While I remain unconvinced that the world really needs this particular standard, we spent a little time talking about Web services, the role of the Web in building applications, and a few other things I&#8217;ll refrain from blogging about right now.</p>

<p>One thing I found very interesting was his view about eventing and notification standards such as <a href="http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/webservices/library/specification/ws-eventing/">WS-Eventing</a> and <a href="http://www-106.ibm.com/developerworks/library/specification/ws-notification/">WS-Notification</a> which was, to phrase it lightly, a little on the unfavorable side. He is undoubtedly right that for delivering notifications in Internet scale, RSS or Atom are much more suitable solutions &#8230; so I hereby officially suggest to come up with a few ways to plug syndication technologies into the WS stack. Updates to entities in a UDDI registry as well as integration into content-based routing solutions are the first that cross my mind. WS-Atom!</p>
