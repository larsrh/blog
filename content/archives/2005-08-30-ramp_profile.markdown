<p>For some reason, Chris Ferris&#8217;s RSS feed URL changed (from <a href="http://www-106.ibm.com/developerworks/blogs/dw_blog_rss.jspa?ca=drs-&amp;blog=440">that</a> to <a href="http://www-128.ibm.com/developerworks/blogs/dw_blog_rss.jspa?ca=drs-&amp;blog=440">this</a>), and I missed <a href="http://www-106.ibm.com/developerworks/blogs/dw_blog_comments.jspa?blog=440&amp;entry=93532&amp;ca=drs-bl">this entry</a> &#8212; and as it happens, <em>somebody else in my current project knew about it before me</em>. </p>

<p>I honestly don&#8217;t know how to deal with this shame and embarrassment.</p>

<p>Anyway, what Chris announced is the <a href="http://www-128.ibm.com/developerworks/webservices/library/specification/ws-ramp/">Reliable Asynchronous Messaging Profile (RAMP)</a>, a new version of IBM&#8217;s B2B profile; in the spirit of the WS-I profiles it clarifies a few ambiguities and sets a few constraints when WS-Addressing and WS-ReliableMessaging are used to support async Web services messaging over HTTP. Very useful and a very good starting point, even if it&#8217;s not an official standard or specification yet (and not likely to become one in the very near future).</p>

<p>Yes, it is pretty sad&#8230; the best thing to do with the dWorks URIs to prevent that is to omit the qualifier. e.g. manually change <a href="http://www-106.ibm.com/..." rel="nofollow" /><a href="http://www-106.ibm.com/&#8230;" rel="nofollow">http://www-106.ibm.com/&#8230;</a> to <a href="http://www.ibm.com/..." rel="nofollow" /><a href="http://www.ibm.com/&#8230;" rel="nofollow">http://www.ibm.com/&#8230;</a></p>

<p>I have tried to explain to the webmasters of the ibm.com domain how brain-dead their load-balancing solution is:-)</p>

<p>As for the comment: &#8220;not likely to become one in the near future&#8221;&#8230; I am working on that.</p>
