<blockquote>
<p>While Ruby doesn&#8217;t have language support for accessing the AST of a piece of code, there are libraries to handle that. The most popular one is <a href="https://rubyforge.org/projects/parsetree/">ParseTree</a>, which returns the AST as a s-expr representation, i.e. nested lists of symbols and literals.</p>
