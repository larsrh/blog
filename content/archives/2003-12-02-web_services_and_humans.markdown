<p><a href="http://weblog.infoworld.com/udell/2003/12/02.html#a856">Jon Udell</a> has written a short <a href="http://www.infoworld.com/article/03/11/26/47FEwsdesk_1.html">article about Web services and human interaction</a>. </p>

<p>This is clearly one of the big chances for advanced Web services solutions to differentiate themselves from classical middleware &mdash; the availability to plug humans into machine-driven processes to handle exceptional conditions.</p>

<p>However fancy your transaction policy, however advanced your error handling implementation might be &mdash; in some cases, there is simply no replacement for having a human look at a situation and apply good old common sense to solve problems.</p>
