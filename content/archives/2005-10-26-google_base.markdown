<p><a href="http://battellemedia.com/archives/001960.php">All you base are belong to Google</a>? Something called <a href="http://base.google.com">Google Base</a> was apparently sort of online.</p>
<p>From <a href="http://blog.outer-court.com/archive/2005-10-25-n57.html">Google Blogoscoped</a> (<a href="http://www.25hoursaday.com/weblog/PermaLink.aspx?guid=b1ba8302-f18f-41ef-b080-e0d68c0d9a74">via Dare</a>):</p>

<p>Post your items on Google.</p>
<p>Google Base is Google&#8217;s database into which you can add all types of content. We&#8217;ll host your content and make it searchable online for free.</p>
<p>Examples of items you can find in Google Base:</p>
<ul>
<li>Description of your party planning service</li>
<li>Articles on current events from your website</li>
<li>Listing of your used car for sale</li>
<li>Database of protein structures</li>
</ul>
<p>You can describe any item you post with attributes, which will help people find it when they search Google Base. In fact, based on the relevance of your items, they may also be included in the main Google search index and other Google products like Froogle and Google Local.</p>

<p>the best summary i can find for this (if correct), is that its a flickr for anything. but it appears that they are offering you the ability to submit typed data, i.e. real estate listings, etc (they provide forms asking square footage, number of bathrooms, etc).</p>

<p>so its a raw storage mechanism with typed data fields being rolled out on a needs basis or as the market demands.</p>

<p>i am not sure how this makes money, and it will certainly cost a lot of money to run, but it appears to be an powerful platform.</p>
