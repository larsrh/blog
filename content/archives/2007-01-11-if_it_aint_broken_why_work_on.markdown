<blockquote>
<p>Q. Wouldn&#8217;t it be easier for you to do the stuff that you do in LISP or Smalltalk? In other words why aren&#8217;t you working in LISP or Smalltalk instead of Ruby?</p>

<p>A. It&#8217;s a question I get a lot. I love those languages, but they are not broken. They don&#8217;t need as much work and I work with things that are broken, because that&#8217;s just how I&#8217;m wired. I see where red flags are raised and I go attack them.</p>
