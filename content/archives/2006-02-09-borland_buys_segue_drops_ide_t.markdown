<p>Not that I have used any Borland tool in the last 10 years or so, but I still find this interesting:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Borland [&#8230;] is acquiring [&#8230;] Segue in a deal worth about $100 million and is dropping its IDE tools business, which analysts estimate to be worth about $60 million to $100 million. [&#8230;] However, Nielsen said Borland is seeking a buyer for the IDE business, one that will keep the unit intact, and invest in and grow the technologies. </p>

<p>I happened to see a blog entry bashing Segue&#8217;s SilkPerformer. Maybe Borland will be able to make it better? :-)
