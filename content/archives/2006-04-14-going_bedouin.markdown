<blockquote>
<p>By focusing almost exclusively on service-based infrastructure options, a business could operate as a sort of neo-Bedouin clan - with workers as a roaming nomadic tribe carrying laptops &#38; cell phones and able to set up shop wherever there is an Internet connection, chairs, tables, and sources of caffeine. </p>
