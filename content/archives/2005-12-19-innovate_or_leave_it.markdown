<p>A very interesting <a href="http://www.25hoursaday.com/weblog/PermaLink.aspx?guid=ba90f4aa-4a07-4f3e-a318-bc1095c61980">post by Dare Obasanjo</a> on Microsoft&#8217;s decision to abandon IE for Mac:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Microsoft should either cede innovation in the Web browser to Mozilla/Google or make IE more than just &#8220;icing on the Windows user experience cake&#8221;by transfering the product to a team whose bottom line depends on browser innovation. Of course, I doubt that my words will be taken seriously by folks at Microsoft [except as a reason to send my boss or his boss angry mail] but this needs to be said.</p>
