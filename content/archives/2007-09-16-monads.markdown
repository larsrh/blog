<p><a href="http://www.bofh.org.uk/articles/2007/08/07/monads">Piers Cawley</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Monads are a generalization of this principle; in a sense, the details of how they work are irrelevant (in the same way that the innards of an ordered pair are irrelevant), what&#8217;s important is that they provide a box in which ordered execution can happen. And ordered execution is what you need if you want to write code that uses side effects or works with impure &#8216;functions&#8217; that don&#8217;t always return the same value given the same input.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Monads; one of the things I&#8217;ve always wanted to spend some time understanding, but never found the time to do &#8230; this will suffice for a while.</p>
