<p>I noticed that a couple of people received multiple trackback pings when I post something related to their entries. A search dug up <a href="http://www.movabletype.org/support/?act=ST&f=18&t=7303&hl=pingtimeout" title="movabletype.org : Support Forum">this thread in the movabletype support forum</a>, which explains that MT waits for a timeout and tries to send a ping again later, e.g. when you update your entry. <br />
So there seems to be nothing I can do about this. The protocol should have specified trackback entries to be idempotent ...</p>
