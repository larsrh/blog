<p><a href="http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2005/05/03/Replacing-WSDL">Tim Bray</a> proposes <a href="http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2005/05/03/SMEX-D">SMEX-D</a>, yet another alternative to WSDL.</p>

<p>Two things I immediately don&#8217;t like:
* The insistence on request/response &#8212; while this is the most popular MEP, it is by no means the only one.
* Describing SOAP header schemas together with the &#8220;business&#8221; message - this should composable, orthogonal concepts.</p>

<p>And of course, Tim should take a look at the <a href="http://www.ssdl.org/">SSDL</a> work.</p>
