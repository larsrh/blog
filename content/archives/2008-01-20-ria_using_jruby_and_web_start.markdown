<p>The application does tons of vector drawing&#8230;. it draws hundreds of thousands, even millions, of line segments. Yet it needed to be responsive&#8230; scrolling, zooming, panning. It&#8217;s data intensive, too. It downloads dozens of megabytes of data for each view. I needed to develop this program fast, so I needed a programming system and platform allowing me to iterate and adapt to new requirements recursively revealed. [&#8230;] So here&#8217;s the spoiler: I chose Java Web Start + JRuby. And now a short dissertation on how I arrived at that choice.</p>
