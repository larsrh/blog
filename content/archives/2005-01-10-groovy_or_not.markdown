<p>First <a href="http://www.pyrasun.com/mike/mt/archives/2005/01/09/20.57.06/index.html">Mike Spille</a>, now <a href="http://www.manageability.org/blog/stuff/what-is-wrong-with-groovy">Carlos Perez</a>: both take a closer look at <a href="http://groovy.codehaus.org/">Groovy</a>, with rather frustrating results. I had high hopes for the language, but have not invested the time to stay current with regards to its development, but this doesn&#8217;t sound too good &#8230;</p>
