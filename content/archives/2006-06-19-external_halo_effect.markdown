<p>One thing I noticed during my time as a consultant is the &#8220;external halo effect&#8221; - it was frequently the case that internal developers at a shop I&#8217;d visit would know what was wrong, and how to fix it - but none of the management or architects/IT standards types would listen to them. In I&#8217;d come, with far less expertise on the problem at hand, but with the &#8220;external vendor expert&#8221; stamp. The amazing this was, I&#8217;d say the same thing that the internal guys did, and get listened to!<br /><br />I&#8217;ve spoken to plenty of other people who are (or have been) in similar situations, and they report the same thing. So what advice would I give McGovern (et. al.)? Pay a lot more attention to your development staff. Stop listening to industry analysts as a first and only source of wisdom (which is not to say they don&#8217;t have any - it&#8217;s to say that you may well find the same thing for free in your own shop).</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve noticed this very often myself. In one project I consulted with, this was taken to an extreme &#8212; the company brought in to do a review (not mine, BTW) basically interviewed all of the developers, got their criticism and recommendations, made a review report out of that, and as a result took over the project &#8230;</p>
