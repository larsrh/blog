<p><a href="http://www.bruceeckel.com/">Bruce Eckel</a> has writte <a href="http://www.artima.com/weblogs/viewpost.jsp?thread=122020">a very thoughtful piece</a> about the economics of consulting companies (be sure to read <a href="http://www.artima.com/forums/flat.jsp?forum=106&amp;thread=122020">the comments</a> as well).</p>

<p>My opinion has always been that there&#8217;s a natural limit to a company&#8217;s size if a goal is to maintain quality. Once the number of people who work in the company becomes large enough, it&#8217;s going to become representative of the population and you&#8217;ll end up with a Gaussian bell curve: A few great people, some idiots, and a large amount of folks with mediocre skills in the middle.</p>
