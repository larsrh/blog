<p><a href="http://llava.org/">Llava</a> is yet another variant of Lisp/Scheme (well, something like it) integrated with Java, created by <a href="http://haroldcarr.net/computers/llava/2004-09-06-llavaLaborDayRelease.html">Harold Carr</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Why not create a version of Java which uses LISP syntax (or, more precisely, LISP&#8217;s lack of syntax) to write Java classes? Then extend that system to include a few special forms (LAMBDA, DEFINE, SET!, IF, DEFINE-SNYTAX, <strong>*</strong>), and a read-eval-print loop and support for incremental (re)definition to support interactive program development. In other words, a minimal LISP system with complete interoperability with Java to leverage the Java Virtual Machine and growing Java class libraries.</p>

<p>Why not, indeed! (via <a href="http://www.holgerarendt.de/uncommented/">Holger Arendt</a>)</p>
