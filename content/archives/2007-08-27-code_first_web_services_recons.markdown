<blockquote>
<p>The most common approach to web services development is to start from code, and generate an XML Schema and WSDL definition. Most web service advocates consider this &#8220;wrong&#8221;, the reason being that this often leads to interoperability problems and a very tight couping between implementation and interface artifacts. Instead, they argue one should start with a WSDL file, and then generate implementation code &#8211; possibly for different consumer and provider frameworks. <br /> <a href="http://www.infoq.com/articles/sosnoski-code-first">In a new InfoQ article</a>, Dennis Sosnoski questions this conventional wisdom, and explains that most of the problems with the code-first (or &#8220;start-from-code approach, as he calls it) are rooted in the first generation tooling. He shows how the JiBX framework can be used to  practice start-from-code development without incurring the disadvantages, specifically without coupling implementation and interface too tightly.</p>
