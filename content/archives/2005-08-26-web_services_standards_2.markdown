<p>My company is currently creating a huge poster covering most, if not all, relevant standards within the Web services world. If any of you knowledgeable folks reading this would care to do a review of the PDF, I would mail you three copies of the thing (DIN A0, which translates into 84,1cm by 118,9cm (roughly 3 by 4ft)) once it&#8217;s finalized in return &#8230; just drop me an email at <a href="mailto:stefan.tilkov@innoq.com">stefan.tilkov@innoq.com</a>.  The first five only :-)</p>
