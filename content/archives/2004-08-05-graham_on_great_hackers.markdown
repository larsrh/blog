<p>I find <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/gh.html">this one</a> to be one of <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com">Paul Graham</a>&#8217;s weaker essays (I can live with the Java remarks, but find the open source one to be way off), but this paragraph fascinated me:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You might think that you could make your products beautiful just by hiring a great designer to design them. But if you yourself don&#8217;t have good taste, how are you going to recognize a good designer? By definition you can&#8217;t tell from his portfolio. And you can&#8217;t go by the awards he&#8217;s won or the jobs he&#8217;s had, because in design, as in most fields, those tend to be driven by fashion and schmoozing, with actual ability a distant third. There&#8217;s no way around it: you can&#8217;t manage a process intended to produce beautiful things without knowing what beautiful is. American cars are ugly because American car companies are run by people with bad taste.</p>
