<p>David and Larry presented <a href="http://rubyforge.org/projects/informl/">Informl</a>, which is a sort of open source DabbleDB/Jotspot-style Wiki based on Rails. Similar to Twiki, the user can edit a Wiki page and include form elements. The text is parsed using a generic parser engine called Tartan. Informl creates both metadata entries as well as &#8220;real&#8221; tables for every user-created element, using Rails migrations. Not uninteresting.</p>
