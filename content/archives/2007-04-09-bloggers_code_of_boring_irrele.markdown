<p>I had promised myself to stay out of this, but Elliotte Rusty Harold&#8217;s post &#8220;<a href="http://www.elharo.com/blog/software-development/web-development/blogging/2007/04/09/bloogers-code-of-boring-irrelevance/">Blogger&#8217;s Code of Boring Irrelevance</a>&#8221; is too great not to link to:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Tim O&#8217;Reilly is pushing a Bloggers&#8217; Code of Conduct. Frankly this whole idea is bad, but what he proposes goes so far beyond anything I imagined I find it hard to believe. If adopted, it would eviscerate the blogosphere and censor millions of voices. Fortunately it won&#8217;t be adopted. Let&#8217;s see why.</p>
