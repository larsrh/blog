<p><a href="http://blogs.sun.com/bblfish/entry/you_are_a_terrorist">Henry Story</a> has a good summary of what's happening in Europe:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Every country in Europe seems to be on the verge of introducing extremely powerful legislation for state monitoring of the internet, bringing us a lot closer to the dystopia described in George Orwell's novel Nineteen Eighty Four. Under the guise of laws to help combat terrorism or pedophilia - emotional subjects that immediately get everybody's unthinking assent - massive powers are to be given to the state, which could very easily be misused. As internauts we all need to make it our duty to follow very closely these debates, and participate actively in them, if we do not want to find ourselves waking up one morning in a world that is the exact opposite of what we have been dreaming of.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I could not agree more. At least there are already <a href="https://epetitionen.bundestag.de/index.php?action=petition;sa=details;petition=3860">more than 88,000 people</a> who have signed an online petition against the amazingly stupid and entirely useless law that would enable censorship.</p>

<p>Wow, that&#8217;s really amazing. At least that would be unthinkable in Germany. I hope.</p>

<p>Do you know that EVERYONE (not only Germans, not only people who live in Germany, even not only adults) may support the online petition? - If you can speak enough German to register to the system, you can help to stop censoring in Germany - once registered just follow the link there above (&#8220;more than 88.000 people&#8221;) and then click &#8220;Petition mitzeichnen&#8221; in the 3. blue box&#8230;</p>
