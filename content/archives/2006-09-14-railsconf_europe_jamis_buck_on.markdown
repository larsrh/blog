<p><a href="http://jamis.jamisbuck.org/">Jamis Buck</a> gave a talk on Capistrano. Initially, this did not work terribly well &#8212; he focused on new features in Capistrano 1.2 and was already answering final questions when someone in the audience asked whether the time left might not be used to actually <em>introduce</em> it. It turned out almost half the audience didn&#8217;t know it at all. Jamis did a quick intro then, which, together with the related Q&#38;As, was actually very good. There was a very funny moment when, during his online demo, he accidentally <code>rm -rf</code>ed his Capistrano installation. Luckily, the same conference WiFi I&#8217;m using allowed him to restore from his Subversion repository.</p>

<p>Capistrano seems worth checking out for any project, not only Rails-based ones &#8212; I can easily imagine it being used in any of our J2EE projects.</p>
