<p>Sean McGrath, in a <a href="http://seanmcgrath.blogspot.com/archives/2004_05_23_seanmcgrath_archive.html#108547015210670520">blog entry</a>, links to <a href="http://www.itworld.com/nl/ebiz_ent/05252004/">yet another article</a> (does he do anything else than write articles?). The article makes a nice analogy between the paradigm shift from application-driven to even-driven user interfaces and the move from synchronous to asynchronous communications. I fail to see how the critique of BPM engines in the blog entry is backed by the article, though &#8212; last time I looked, something like BPEL (and thus, the engines probably as well) seemed to be suitable for describing interactions where one might have to wait for responses for weeks. Maybe I&#8217;ll need to check again.</p>
