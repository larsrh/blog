<p><a href="http://norman.walsh.name/2005/01/15/spam">Norm Walsh</a> describes his anti-spam setup, which seems pretty smart. Still, I have decided that setting everything up this way, and more importantly, maintaining it, is too much work for my taste &#8212; so I&#8217;ll take the opportunity to once again recommend <a href="http://www.appriver.com/">AppRiver</a>, a anti-spam and anti-virus service provider. The way to use it to simply change one&#8217;s DNS MX record, and mail gets filtered and then forwarded to the destination email servers. Although we struggled with <a href="/blog/st/2004/04/appriver_opinion.html">some initial problems</a> a while back, we&#8217;re totally happy that 90% (and, more importantly, the right 90%) of our email doesn&#8217;t even reach our servers. This is definitely the future &#8212; no software to set up, nothing to maintain, great results, and <a href="http://www.appriver.com/tr_.asp">a free trial</a> to check whether it&#8217;s worth it.</p>

<p>I agree that outsourcing email administration is the way to go and I&#8217;m collecting a list of providers who offer this on my IMAP Service Providers page, which is here:</p>

<p>I have some questions about AppRiver: How much are they charging you? How many users do you have? I&#8217;m not able to view any of their documentation, e.g., their FAQ, so at the moment I&#8217;m wary of them.</p>

<p>Thank you,
Nancy</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t know current pricing, but I believe we pay something like 50$/month for &lt;50 mailboxes.</p>
