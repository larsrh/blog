<p>Americans with PhDs beware: Telling people in Germany that you're a doctor could land you in jail.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I'm not entirely sure whether this is sad or funny. </p>

<p>I thought in Germany, holders of masters degrees are Doktors?</p>

<p>This is a clear case for classic ternary logic: When you can&#8217;t decide whether it is good or bad it is certainly ugly.</p>

<p>@Martin: No, you have to write a dissertation which - depending on the field - can take you several years in addition to (the rough equivalent of) a Master&#8217;s degree. </p>

<p>At least according to the newsmagazin Spiegel this is no longer true. In its issue 11/10.03.08, p.68 it
writes that US citizens with a Ph.D. may use &#8220;Dr&#8221; as a title. </p>

<p>I think you clearly have to differentiate between Berufsdoktorat (professional degrees)and Forschungsdoktorat (research degree). A US M.D. (doctor of medicine) is equivalent to a medizinisches Staatsexamen, but NOT a German doctor of medicine (Dr. Med.), which need dissertation. For Forschungsdoktorat (research degree) you can choose which title you want to hold in Germany (either Ph.D. or Dr.) but not both!. </p>

<p>Secondly you need to proof &#8220;equivalence of graduation&#8221;. Which is given for graduations granted from research universities (based on Carnegie-Foundation classification scheme). Ph.D Graduations from other intituation are highly questionable.</p>
