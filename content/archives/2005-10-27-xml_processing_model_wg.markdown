<p><a href="http://norman.walsh.name/2005/10/27/xmlProcModel">Norm Walsh</a> will chair the new W3C <a href="http://www.w3.org/XML/Processing/">XML Processing Model working group</a>, the task of which it is to define a standard language for describing an XML processing pipeline. Very cool! Even better is Norm&#8217;s attitude towards the whole thing:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There has been a lot of work done in this area. A half hour spent with a search engine and my mail archives turned up all of these efforts either about XML pipelines or directly related to them [&#8230;] I want to figure out what 80% of the intersection of those languages is, write it up as a specification, slap &#8220;1.0&#8221; on it, and ship it. <em>As soon as possible</em>. Then I want to get support for that language coded up and into the Java&#8482; Platform so it&#8217;ll be available everywhere.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Sounds like a great plan.</p>
