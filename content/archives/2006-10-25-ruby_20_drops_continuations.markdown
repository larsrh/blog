<p>I had missed this in Charles Oliver Nutter&#8217;s <a href="http://headius.blogspot.com/2006/10/another-year-another-interpreter.html">original post</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>So what happened? Sometime around JavaOne we heard about the Ruby KaiGi in Japan, a Ruby conference or get-together of some sort. If RubyConf is the big conference for us Westerners, this at least provided a mid-year update for English-speaking Rubyists. Matz was there, Koichi was there, and I believe other Ruby dignitaries made the trip as well.</p>

<p>And then Matz and Koichi dropped the bomb: Ruby 2.0 would support neither continuations nor green threads.</p>

<p><a href="http://pluralsight.com/blogs/dbox/archive/2006/10/25/41184.aspx">Don Box</a>  and <a href="http://www.cincomsmalltalk.com/blog/blogView?showComments=true&amp;entry=3339237662">James Robertson</a> both linked to it today. While I don&#8217;t see much loss in dropping green threads, I&#8217;m not so sure about continuations &#8230; apart from <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=web+frameworks+continuation">continuation-based Web frameworks</a>, I really like examples such as <a href="http://intertwingly.net/stories/2006/07/30/expatparser.rb">Sam Ruby&#8217;s Expat-based pull parser</a>.</p>
