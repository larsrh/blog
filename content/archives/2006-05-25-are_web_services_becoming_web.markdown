<p><a href="http://www.markbaker.ca/2002/09/Blog/2006/05/23#2006-05-ws-revolt">Mark Baker</a> notes that at <a href="http://www.xtech.org/">XTech</a>, the term <em>Web service</em> was used to describe RESTful, non-WS-* implementations. I think this is just great &#8212; after all, what can be wrong with Web services embracing Web principles?</p>
