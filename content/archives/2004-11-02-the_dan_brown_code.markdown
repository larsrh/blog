<p>This is rather old (in blogosphere terms), but I only just stumbled across it. A <a href="/blog/st/2004/05/09/recent_reading.html">while ago</a> I admitted to having read <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0385504209">The DaVinci Code</a> (who hasn&#8217;t), so I found this extraordinarily entertaining: </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Brown&#8217;s writing is not just bad; it is staggeringly, clumsily, thoughtlessly, almost ingeniously bad. In some passages scarcely a word or phrase seems to have been carefully selected or compared with alternatives. I slogged through 454 pages of this syntactic swill, and it never gets much better. Why did I keep reading? Because London Heathrow is a long way from San Francisco International, and airline magazines are thin, and two-month-old Hollywood drivel on a small screen hanging two seats in front of my row did not appeal, that&#8217;s why. And why did I keep the book instead of dropping it into a Heathrow trash bin? Because it seemed to me to be such a fund of lessons in how not to write.</p>

<p>Be sure to read <a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/000844.html">the whole thing</a>.</p>
