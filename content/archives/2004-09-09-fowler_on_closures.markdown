<p>An excellent explanation, thanks for the link!  I&#8217;ll distribute it to a couple of friends who have yet to See the Light(tm) :)  Of course, it would have been nice if Martin Fowler had also mentioned Perl in the list of languages that support closures naturally, but then he&#8217;d probably also have to list Python and a whole slew of others&#8230;</p>
