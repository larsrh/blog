<p><a href="http://www.windley.com/archives/2005/10/tinydisk_lesson.shtml">Phil Windley</a> writes about <a href="http://www.msblabs.org/tinydisk/index.php">TinyDisk</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>TinyDisk shows that anything that stores anything on the Web can be used to store something else by encoding the something else into the Web-based storage system. In the case of TinyDisk, it&#8217;s a Web-based file system that slices up a file, encrypts it, and stores it out on TinyURL.</p>
