<p>Show me the interoperable, full and free implementations of WS-* in Python, Perl, Ruby and PHP. You won&#8217;t see them, because there&#8217;s no intrinsic value in WS-* unless you&#8217;re trying to suck money out of your customers. Its complexity serves as a barrier to entry at the same time that it creates &#8220;value&#8221; that can be sold.</p>
