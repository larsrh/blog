<p>Living in Germany, I view this from an outside perspective only and do not really care that much. Still, I find it funny that <a href="http://www.presidentmatch.com/Guide.jsp2">in this test</a> I took, George W. Bush came to a last place with 18% (after Lieberman with 70%, 100% went to Sharpton. Whoever that is.) I find this pretty funny since I&#8217;d be considered pretty conservative in this country. (Test found via <a href="http://www.25hoursaday.com/weblog/PermaLink.aspx?guid=77c6c5a4-8b71-46a2-a461-41d171dca451">Dare Obsanjo</a>.)</p>

<p>Funny &#8220;related Link&#8221;.
&#8220;match in heaven&#8221; relates to &#8220;President Match&#8221;?
Or does &#8220;Java&#8221; relate to &#8220;Bush&#8221; in any way?</p>

<p>Yes, I know; I need to work on that &#8230; the related links are generated automatically by a Movabletype plugin that does a full-text index in the blog database to see whether they are any entries that have one or more of the same words in the title. This time, it&#8217;s simply the word &#8220;match&#8221; &#8230;</p>
