<p>From <a href="http://daringfireball.net/2004/06/broken_windows">another great essay </a>by <a href="http://daringfireball.net">John Gruber</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In the hands of a typical user, a six-month-old Mac is almost certainly in similar working condition as when it left the store; a six-month-old Windows PC, on the other hand, is likely to be infested with multiple instances of crapware. And if it&#8217;s not, it&#8217;s likely because the poor sap who bought it just got done reinstalling from scratch.</p>
