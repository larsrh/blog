<p>Do you hear that giant sucking sound? That&#8217;s the air supply for proprietary J2EE implementations being removed from the market.</p>

<p>I am amazed. It&#8217;s not that I have anything against Geronimo &#8212; I haven&#8217;t looked at it seriously yet, but I do believe it&#8217;s going to become an alternative many companies will consider. But at the risk of being perceived as an open source basher, here&#8217;s an important truth for <strike>hypeseekers</strike>journalists:</p>

<p><em>Just because something is open source doesn&#8217;t necessarily mean it has a high quality.</em></p>

<p>It seems Open Source is starting to slide down into the <a href="http://www.wordspy.com/words/hypecycle.asp">trough of disillusionment</a>.</p>

<p>I fully agree.
Currently &#8220;OSS&#8221; seams to be mixedup with &#8220;Linux&#8221; or &#8220;apache webserver&#8221;. Of cource these projects are highly supported by big companies like IBM, Sun, HP &#8230; and surely have a high quality.
But that&#8217;s not automaicaly true for all the other projects found on sourceforge or even on apache.org.</p>
