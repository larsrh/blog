<p>A very <a href="http://www.theserverside.com/articles/article.tss?l=NetKernel">readable article on TSS</a> about the <a href="http://www.1060.org/">1060 NetKernel</a> (I briefly <a href="/blog/st/archives/000618.html">mentioned it</a> some time ago). </p>

<p>From a business perspective, I find <a href="http://www.1060research.com/license/">the dual license model</a> they use pretty interesting. </p>

<p>The author, Peter Rodgers, also has very thoughtful answers in the <a href="http://www.theserverside.com/news/thread.tss?thread_id=24533">associated discussion thread</a>. My favorite:</p>

<blockquote>As a general observation. Our feeling is that with the XML-service world, the application must eventually handle the XML message no matter what the protocol. For many XML processing problems we&#8217;ve found that the later you bind to procedural objects the better - ie when you have the choice, keep your system loosly coupled.</blockquote>

<p>Amen to that.</p>
