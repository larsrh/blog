<p><a href="http://www-128.ibm.com/developerworks/blogs/dw_blog_comments.jspa?blog=440&amp;entry=109251&amp;ca=drs-bl">Chris Ferris</a> has a very reasonable follow-up to <a href="http://www.1060.org/blogxter/entry?publicid=D06291B67CB855C5250C81341295B366">Steve Loughran&#8217;s post</a>. Although the two of them disagree, I have a lot of agreements with both of them; details will have to wait until I&#8217;m a little less tired. But I need to get one thing off my chest: I consider <a href="http://www.w3.org/Submission/ws-polling/">WS-Polling</a> to be one of the best examples of WS-Horror &#8230;</p>
