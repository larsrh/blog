<p><a href="http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2006/11/27/Choose-Relax">Tim Bray</a> agrees with Elliotte Rusty Harold&#8217;s <a href="http://cafe.elharo.com/xml/relax-wins/">view on RELAX NG</a>. I&#8217;ve always liked RELAX NG, especially the compact syntax. If you don&#8217;t know it, check out <a href="http://relaxng.org/compact-tutorial-20030326.html">this tutorial</a>, or even <a href="http://relaxng.org/compact-20021121.html">the spec</a> itself (which makes you wish more XML and WS-* specifications were written by <a href="http://www.jclark.com/bio.htm">James Clark</a>).</p>
