<p>I recently came across a presentation from a not-so-small vendor (left unnamed to protect the innocent), targeted at their internal sales force. Among others, it included this great statement:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If your prospects are using open source [XXX] today &#8211; add FUD
* Who is going to support the software
* What about enterprise QOS
* What happens when it does not perform
* Will the open-source project evolve with the standards</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Not that I&#8217;m really amazed by a company doing this, nor do I necessarily disagree with the arguments &#8212; but semi-publically suggesting FUD? Wow.</p>
