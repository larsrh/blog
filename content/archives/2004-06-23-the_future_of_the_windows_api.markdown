<p>A nice follow-up by <a href="http://daringfireball.net/2004/06/location_field">John Gruber</a> to <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/APIWar.html">Joel Spolsky&#8217;s essay</a> from last  week:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I&#8217;ve been thinking about the rise of the web as an application platform for a while. But what hadn&#8217;t occurred to me until I read Spolsky&#8217;s essay last week is this, which I think is quite remarkable: Microsoft totally fucked up when they took aim at Netscape. It wasn&#8217;t Netscape that was a threat to Windows as an application platform, it was the web itself.</p>
