<p>Steve Vinoski nails it:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Which is better: implementation code polluted with a bunch of weird square bracket annotations that inextricably (and also inexplicably) hard-wire your code to what goes on the wire, or nice, clean service contracts that keep implementation details separate? I prefer the angle brackets to the square ones, thanks.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I couldn&#8217;t agree more. <a href="http://staff.newtelligence.net/clemensv/PermaLink.aspx?guid=86fdfcaa-9df9-4b71-822a-fcc77453da33">Clemens Vasters&#8217;s post</a>, talking about brand-new technology, made me feel like I were back in 2003 &#8230;</p>

<p>Update: <a href="http://www.1060.org/blogxter/entry?publicid=FD48F7B1BC4ABBFFAB28883887DC6D0F">Yet another great post</a> concerning the subject.</p>
