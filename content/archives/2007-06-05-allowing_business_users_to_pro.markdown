<blockquote>
<p>I don&#8217;t know about you, but every company I&#8217;ve ever worked at had a Fort Knox like system in place for deploying code to the production server. [&#8230;] The solution is not to make programming more like the way business users work now. The solution is to apply the lessons learned from software development into other business processes.</p>
</blockquote>
