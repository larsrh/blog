<blockquote>
<p>Everybody&#8217;s atwitter about WADL, a description file for REST services, and since it&#8217;s supposed to be RESTful I regularly get questioned about it. For this post I&#8217;m going to experiment and adopt Stephen O&#8217;Grady&#8217;s Q&#38;A style.</p>

<p><em>Excellent</em> stuff from Joe Gregorio; I particularly like the <code>thing/thing</code> MIME type analogy.</p>
