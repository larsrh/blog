<blockquote>
<p>Implementing a blog is writing a tiny handler that shoves stuff into the database and out of it, and then spending ridiculous amounts of time filtering comments for spam. Which is one of the really difficult things to do on the internet - validating users as real users, without being inaccessible.</p>
