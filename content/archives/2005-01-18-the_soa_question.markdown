<p><a href="http://weblog.infoworld.com/udell/2005/01/18.html#a1153">Jon Udell</a> poses a question to the SOA community:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>As a language of contracts, SOA involves complex shapes. But as a Lego system, it&#8217;s about simple shapes. Where&#8217;s the sweet spot?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A great analogy. I can&#8217;t seem to make up my mind which approach I like better. As I understand them, in the simple-shape approach I create complex things by combining building blocks that share a common interface. If you&#8217;ve played with Lego in the early 1970s, like I have, you were used to build stuff out of simple bricks and plates that varied in the number of &#8220;connector pins&#8221; &#8212; 1 to 20, maybe &#8212;, and were (mostly) of rectangular shape. Sure, the result looked like a pixel graphic zoomed in more than appropriate, but essentially everything was combinable with everything else.</p>

<p>But if I look at my son&#8217;s Lego toys today, they are <em>very</em> different. <a href="http://shop.lego.com/department.asp?d=6&#38;t=3">Bionicles</a>, <a href="http://shop.lego.com/department.asp?d=9&#38;t=4">Racers</a>, <a href="http://shop.lego.com/department.asp?d=20&#38;t=3">movie merchandising stuff</a> &#8212; few complex shapes, easily combinable only within their respective &#8220;family&#8221;. The result might look more fancy, but its a lot more static. And while the <a href="http://shop.lego.com/product.asp?p=4411&#38;cn=44&#38;d=11&#38;t=5">bricks and plates</a> I grew up with are still around today, I wonder whether the more complex stuff will be, 30 thirty years from now. </p>

<p>Although I do not have an answer, I believe this is definitely the right question to ask.</p>
