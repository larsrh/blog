<p>The W3C has published a first working draft for a <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2005/WD-wsdl20-rdf-20051104/">WSDL 2.0 Mapping to RDF</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If a WSDL document describes about a Web service, a policy document attaches constraints to the service and a general description specifies the author of the service, all this information can be merged and the resulting document will contain all the three kinds of information assigned to the single service. The main objective of this specification is to present a standard RDF vocabulary equivalent to WSDL 2, so that all WSDL 2 documents can be transformed into RDF and merged with other Semantic Web data. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I somehow have the feeling that there can be no more a handful of people in the world who not only understand both WSDL 2 <em>and</em> RDF, but also would like to use <em>both</em>. <a href="http://www.jacek.cz/blog/">Jacek</a> seems to be one of them. </p>
