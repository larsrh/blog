<blockquote>
<p>I was in the process of considering the alternatives when I finally understood REST. And wow, it was eye-opening. REST is often positioned as CRUD operations against entities identified by URIs. Then it is dismissed as to simplistic to be useful. You can&#8217;t build with just CRUD, the reasoning goes, just think about why we write sprocs. I&#8217;ve been down that path any number of times and always ended up in the same place. But I had it all wrong.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is great news &#8212; having someone like Tim contribute his ideas to REST best practices will be awesome.</p>
