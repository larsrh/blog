<p><a href="http://martinfowler.com/bliki/ObservedRequirement.html">Martin Fowler</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Agile methods violate this underlying assumption [collecting requirements up front] by intending to discover the 'requirements' during construction and after delivery. But even this cavalier disregard of the above sage advice is nothing compared to what many leading web sites do these days. These sites explore requirements by observing what the users do on their sites and using that information to generate ideas for new features[.]</p>
