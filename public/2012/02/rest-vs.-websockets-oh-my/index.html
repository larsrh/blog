	  <p>There is an entirely absurd discussion going on about &ldquo;REST
vs. Websockets&rdquo;, predictably claiming that in the long term, REST will
be succeeded by Websockets. This is stupid on many levels. I&rsquo;ll try
to be brief:</p>

<ul>
<li>To be pedantic, REST vs. &hellip; almost never makes sense, as people are
rarely talking about REST (the architectural style) in comparison to
another architectural style. But never mind, let&rsquo;s assume that what
was meant was actually &ldquo;RESTful HTTP&rdquo; vs. &ldquo;Websockets&rdquo;, then &hellip;</li>
<li>Websockets is not something &ldquo;more&rdquo;, it doesn&rsquo;t add something, it&rsquo;s
not dynamic, or interactive, or in any way &ldquo;good&rdquo; &ndash; unless you make
the same claim about TCP. Websockets essentially allows you build
your own proprietary protocols that may or may not be great, with
all the typical advantages and disadvantages these end up having:
possibly better performance, possibly better suited to the specific
task at hand, less standardized, not widely implemented, etc. It&rsquo;s
not a case of one being better than the other, it&rsquo;s about being
different.</li>
<li>In the long run, HTTP (used in a way aligned with its architectural
goals) will continue to have benefits for loosely coupling
systems. If that&rsquo;s what you want, it makes the most sense. If you&rsquo;re
after the most efficient communication possible, and are willing to
sacrifice some of the loose coupling &ndash; fine, go ahead, use
Websockets. But it&rsquo;s not as if one will supersede the other.</li>
<li>Does this mean I claim that HTTP is perfect? Of course not, it most
definitely could be improved. But if this improvement comes, it&rsquo;s
definitely going to introduce more, not less constraints.</li>
</ul>
