<p><a href="http://weblog.infoworld.com/udell/2006/07/05.html#a1481">Jon Udell</a> reminds me again why he&#8217;s my favorite journalist:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In the big picture, none of this matters until we establish the idea that naming, storage, content management, tagging, and community participation are separable concerns. Achieving that separation is technically feasible and very much in the interest of everyone except, of course, the builders of the walled gardens. For obvious reasons they won&#8217;t want to go there. But I wonder for how long they&#8217;ll be able to remain insular.</p>
