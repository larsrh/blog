<blockquote>
<p>Managing changes to APIs is hard. That is no surprise to anyone who has ever maintained an API of any sort. Web services, being a special case of API, are susceptible to many of the difficulties around versioning as other types of APIs. For HTTP based REST style web services the combination of resources and content negotiation can be used to mitigate most of the issues surrounding API versioning.</p>

<p>In another post on the topic, <a href="http://pezra.barelyenough.org/blog/2008/05/versioning-rest-web-services-tricks-and-tips/">Peter addresses the downsides</a> of the approach he suggests (relying on custom media types). </p>
