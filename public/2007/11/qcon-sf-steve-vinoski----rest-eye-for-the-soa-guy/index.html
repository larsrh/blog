	  <p>Here are my unedited notes from Steve Vinoski&#8217;s talk at QCon (&#8220;REST Eye for the SOA Guy&#8221;).</p>

<ul>
<li>Steve does not work for a middleware vendor anymore, nor does he have anything to do with a product in that space</li>
<li><p>Steve has no agenda, no product to sell (in contrast to being at IONA)</p></li>
<li><p>governance as one of the things business likes about SOA - helps to control when divisional boundaries are crossed</p></li>
<li><p>SOA does not mean Scrap Old Applications, State of the Art, Special Object Annotations (Just flat out wrong - classes are entities that belong into a pogram), Samve (vendor) On All, Scalable Optimal Architecture (no magic)</p></li>
<li><p>SOA is comprised of loose recommendations that essentially reiterate elementary software development practices</p></li>
<li>SOA is lacking when it comes to actual architecture (elements, relationships, properties, constraints); technical SOA systems have these, but they&#8217;re not consistent</li>
<li>is really about organizational IT culture, and also nice for control freaks</li>
<li><p>you&#8217;ll never be able to pull of standardizing a whole company on such an approach</p></li>
<li><p>the SOA guy (a bow tie-equipped figure Steve uses in his slides) doesn&#8217;t like it &#8230;</p></li>
<li><p>REST is hypermedia, but not only suitable for browsers</p></li>
<li>major difference to SOA: certain constraints to achieve desirable properties</li>
<li>performance, scalability, portability, simplicity, visibility (ability to monitor and mediate)</li>
<li><p>modifiability, extensibility, evolvability, reliability (handling failure and partial failure), failover, load balancing</p></li>
<li><p>SOA guy: everybody wants those properties, including all SOA systems</p></li>
<li>As SOA has no constraints, it doesn&#8217;t help you there</li>
<li>You want to make tradeoffs and impose constraints that induce properties that you want</li>
<li><p>SOA talks only about the desired outcome, not how to get there</p></li>
<li><p>REST constraints: c/s, stateless, caching, layered, uniform, code-on-demand</p></li>
<li><p>the SOA guys complains C/S has been around forever</p></li>
<li><p>Maybe C/S is the one constraint of SOA</p></li>
<li>Stateless: Clients have app state, resources have resource state, more sensible than the CORBA style of creating an object, book recommendation: &#8220;Release it!&#8221; - trade-off: clients get more complicated. In SOA: undefined</li>
<li>Caching: of all the things you can do, caching gives you the most bang for the buck - Steve regularly uses 3-4 programming languages every day; customer story: reduce time from 4h to 4 seconds by introducing a cache for dumping a repository; in SOA: cache at your own risk or invent your own protocol - a &#8220;huge hole&#8221; in SOA</li>
<li>Layering: in REST, system layers interact only with adjacent layers - in SOA, undefined</li>
<li>Jim: processThis - Steve: governance required</li>
<li>Sanjiva &#38; Glen: HTTP can be mis-used, governance needed there as well</li>
<li>interface and data are both variable - in a REST style: th</li>
<li>e uniform interface takes one variable out</li>
<li>Patrick Logan: is the number of operation a good number to have? SteveV: yes; if you have only one operation, you lose the cacheability effect; having too many operations leads to the governance need </li>
<li>Q: how does the uniform interface allow you to scale?</li>
<li><p>SOA guy: a uniform interface can&#8217;t possibly work? my services all work differently</p></li>
<li><p>revisiting SOA discovery: you need a registry to find something. </p></li>
<li>you have to know something when you look at a registry: the interface you&#8217;re looking for </li>
<li>Q: How can 4 operations be sufficient? Steve: The Web has a number of complex processes, and it&#8217;s working really well - the names of the operation don&#8217;t matter too much</li>
<li>Lots of pages devoted to interface definition specifications in CORBA, COM, WS, &#8230;</li>
<li>Interfaces and Scalability: specialized interfaces inhibit scalability - the likelihood of serendipitous reuse goes down with specialized interfaces</li>
<li>every interface is a new protocol</li>
<li>Sanjiva: Aren&#8217;t specialized resources a specialized protocol, too? Steve: Not every client is generic and can talk to everything, but some can. </li>
<li>Q. Are you saying &#8220;an interface is a protocol&#8221; or &#8220;an interface has a protocol&#8221;? Steve: A bit of both - it tells you how to use the thing at the other end, it&#8217;s just a different layer that the protocol that tells you how to move the bits</li>
<li>Q. Is this related to the sessions: Glen Daniels: it&#8217;s not just a session, even if you don&#8217;t have one, operations might need to be called in a particular order</li>
<li>worked on ORBs for so long that he has now become shaped like one</li>
<li>explanation of the HTTP verbs</li>
<li>The fact that del.icio.us and Flickr use a GET to delete something is just an abuse of the system</li>
<li>plug for Leonard&#8217;s and Sam&#8217;s book</li>
<li>one of the features of REST: the ability to relax constraints</li>
<li><p>one example of abuse: SOAP (tunneling through POST)</p></li>
<li><p>SOA guy: how do I generate code, how do I get type-safe services?</p></li>
<li>never forget that it&#8217;s distributed - reference to Waldo paper</li>
<li>Distributed systems generally don&#8217;t have distributed compile-time type safety and only fake run-time type safety</li>
<li><p>REST focuses on fully hetereogeneous distributed systems because that&#8217;s what &#8220;large-scale&#8221; implies</p></li>
<li><p>SOA guy: but where&#8217;s my IDL? Where&#8217;s my WSDL?</p></li>
<li>Traditional IDL exists for code generation</li>
<li>no automatic systems exist that download any ol&#8217; IDL and generate fully-operational client applications</li>
<li><p>nobody reads <em>only</em> WSDL or IDL to write their clients - always accompanied by documentation</p></li>
<li><p>media types mean data and interface definition become completely orthogonal</p></li>
<li>URIs are cheap - name everything you possibly can</li>
<li>Allow for hyperlinks to guide the application </li>
<li>Keep verbs out of your URIs</li>
<li>Summary: SOA is about IT culture and organizations, not architecture</li>
<li>buy the RESTful Web services book</li>
</ul>

<p>Great talk!</p>

<p>I&#8217;m happy to see such a statement from a guy like Steve &#8230; </p>

<p>And, as you might anticipate: I&#8217;ve told you that for ages. :-)</p>

<p>Even your unedited list of bullet points creates a nice picture of the talk. Hoping to hear/see/read the edited story&#8230; </p>

<p>Best,</p>

<p>Phillip</p>
