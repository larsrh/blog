<p><a href="http://www.sauria.com/blog/2003/08/25#517">Ted Leung</a>, who is BTW becoming one of my favorite bloggers, points to <a href="http://dijest.com/aka/2003/08/23.html#a2584" title="Semantic Blogging and the HP demonstrator">HP's structure enhanced blog demonstration</a>, where structured bibligraphy information is added to blog entries. IMHO, this might have great benefits, although the usual risk of a huge number of incompatible vocabularies does exist.</p>
