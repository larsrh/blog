<p>From the <a href="http://dabbledb.com/blog/?p=87">Dabble DB Blog</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Then someone made a joke: why doesn&#8217;t Dabble pick colors automatically when customers upload a logo? Discussing it further, we decided we weren&#8217;t joking. Our graphic designer Luke was somewhat doubtful, but we thought it would be a cool feature, so we dove in.</p>

<p>This kind of (almost) unnecessary features is what turns users into fans.</p>
