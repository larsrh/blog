<p>I&#8217;ve had to delete (or &#8216;de-spam&#8217; in MT-BlackList terminology) about 200 spam trackbacks today (which probably took me about 3 minutes). I wonder why people bother? Probably it&#8217;s harder to check whether the spam pings have any effect than simply to hope for the best. In the end, the spammer&#8217;s and my infrastructure keep on fighting each other &#8230; let&#8217;s hope they at least have some fun.</p>
