<p>There&#8217;s a new meme going around, originally started by <a href="http://pulverblog.pulver.com/archives/006087.html">Jeff Pulver</a>, asking you to share 5 little known facts about yourself and then tag five people from your blogroll to do the same. <a href="http://service-architecture.blogspot.com/index.html">Steve Jones</a> <a href="http://service-architecture.blogspot.com/2006/12/sad-but-it-is-december.html">tagged me</a>, so I&#8217;ll comply:</p>

<ol>
<li>I do not spend the whole day blogging. </li>
<li>I&#8217;m totally into progressive rock/art rock music and spend quite a bit of time organizing my (now digital) collection of Yes, Genesis, Jethro Tull, Marillion, Dream Theater, Spock&#8217;s Beard, Flower Kings, and similar albums.</li>
<li>While my mother is German, my father is Bulgarian. (I don&#8217;t speak a single word, sadly.)</li>
<li>I earned my first &#8220;real&#8221; money when I was 19, by translating the manuals for Excel 2.0 from English to German (1 Deutsche Mark for every standard 55-character line).  </li>
<li>I have a wife and two kids (a boy aged 9 and a girl aged 2) and two dogs (an Irish Terrier and an Airedale Terrier).</li>
</ol>
