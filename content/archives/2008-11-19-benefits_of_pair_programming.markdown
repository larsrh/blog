<p>Aaron Erickson:</p>

<ul>
<li>Surfing the web reading SlashDot/DIGG/etc.together</li>
<li>Surfing the web reading SlashDot/DIGG/etc.together</li>
<li>Reading personal email</li>
<li>Writing personal email</li>
<li>Shopping on amazon.com</li>
<li>Playing solitare</li>
<li>Letting your ego continue to pound away at a problem that, for whatever reason, you can't solve.</li>
</ul>
[â€¦] When pairing, you are much more likely to get the 8 full professional hours per person than you are otherwise.
