	  <p>Being a programming language geek, I typically try to use the
Christmas vacation to learn (or rather, play with) a programming
language I don&rsquo;t know. This year, I find this very hard, as there are
so many interesting languages one could spend time with. Some I have
considered are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Go: I was thoroughly unimpressed with this language when it came
out, and I still fail to see a lot of interesting stuff in it. But
I&rsquo;ve heard many people I respect say only good things about their
experience with it, so maybe I should reconsider.</li>
<li>Rust: At first glance, this seems to be a very nicely designed
language (and it has a really excellent tutorial). Even though its
language features are very advanced, it seems to be intended for
low-level use cases (that I mostly don&rsquo;t have).</li>
<li>Fantom: Seems to be  interesting, too; I remember I looked at it
a long time ago, but never in depth.</li>
</ul>

<p>What do you think? What else is worth a look?</p>
