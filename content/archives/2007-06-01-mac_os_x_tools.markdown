<p>An excellent list from <a href="http://agile-aspects.blogspot.com/2007/05/macbooks-on-rise-tools-revisited.html">Michael Mahlberg</a>. Just for the record: Unbelievably, my current machine does not even have an Emacs installation anymore &#8212; after 15 years, I&#8217;ve switched to <a href="http://macromates.com/">something I like better</a>. Other additions: <a href="http://www.lemkesoft.com/">GraphicConverter</a> is my Swiss knife for everything graphics-related.</p>
