<p>I continue to think the trend towards treating the RDBMS as a dumb indexed filesystem is rather ridiculous.</p>

<p>I couldn&#8217;t agree more &#8212; while an RDBMS is certainly not applicable in every situation, I believe that in &gt;95% of all cases other options are simply not worth the hassle.  </p>

<p>Indeed, most people seem to have forgotten why the relational model &#8220;won&#8221; over network and hierarchical databases.  Or perhaps they never bothered to find out in the first place.</p>

<p>I find a dreadful lack of understanding about data design (whether relational or otherwise) in the industry today.  Just don&#8217;t get me started on some of the nonsense designs or ridiculous SQL that developers seem to come up with!</p>

<p>Hopefully, the current debate over M/R will cause at least some people to revisit our history and actually learn something.  Who knows, we might even make some progress&#8230;</p>
