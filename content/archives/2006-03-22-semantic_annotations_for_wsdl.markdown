<p>The W3C has created a <a href="http://www.w3.org/2002/ws/sawsdl/" title="Semantic Annotations for WSDL Working Group">Semantic Annotations for WSDL Working Group</a> (chaired by <a href="http://www.jacek.cz/" title="Jacek Kopecky">Jacek Kopeck&#253;</a>, congrats); from the <a href="http://www.w3.org/2005/10/sa-ws-charter.html">charter</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The objective of the Semantic Annotations for WSDL Working Group is to develop a mechanism to enable annotation of Web services descriptions. This mechanism will take advantage of the WSDL 2.0 extension mechanisms to build a simple and generic support for semantics in Web services.</p>
