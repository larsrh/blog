<p>Wired has <a href="http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/11.08/pipedream.html" title="Wired 11.08: Fat Pipe Dream">a story about Softbank founder Masayoshi Son</a>, who allegedly lost $75 <em>billion</em> in the dot com crash:</p>

<blockquote>Softbank has spent close to $2 billion building out a gigabit Ethernet network and leasing copper wire from Japanese telecom giant Nippon Telegraph and Telephone. The result is a service, offered under the Yahoo! BB brand, that provides Internet access to Japanese homes at 12 megabits per second - eight times faster than what Americans are used to - for about $21 a month. Every day, as many as 7,000 new subscribers fire up their plug-and-play DSL modems, making Yahoo! BB the world's fastest-growing broadband service.</blockquote>
