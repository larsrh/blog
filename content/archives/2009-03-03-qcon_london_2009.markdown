<p>Like <a href="http://olabini.com/blog/2009/02/qcon-london-and-ioke-geek-night/">Ola Bini</a> and <a href="http://jim.webber.name/2009/03/01/d904e10d-7716-484a-a91b-27d2fff37089.aspx">Jim Webber</a>, I'm very much looking forward to next week's QCon conference in London. I'll be hosting a track on <a href="http://qconlondon.com/london-2009/tracks/show_track.jsp?trackOID=222">"Real World SOA"</a>, and I will present some <a href="http://qconlondon.com/london-2009/presentation/Thoughts+on+the+generic-vs.-specific+trade-off">"Thoughts on the generic-vs.-specific trade-off"</a> in <a href="http://dannorth.net/">Dan North</a>'s <a href="http://qconlondon.com/london-2009/tracks/show_track.jsp?trackOID=233">"Architecture for the Architect"</a> track. But I'll also make sure to attend some of the sessions, such as Michael Nygard's <a href="http://qconlondon.com/london-2009/presentation/Creating+production-ready+software">"Creating production-ready software"</a>, <a href="http://qconlondon.com/london-2009/presentation/Document+Style+Business+Services+at+British+Airways.">"Document Style Business Services at British Airways"</a>, Sadek Dobri's <a href="http://qconlondon.com/london-2009/presentation/Functional+Programming+with+a+Mainstream+Language">"Functional Programming with a Mainstream Language"</a>, and many others. Finally, I will <a href="http://qconlondon.com/london-2009/presentation/REST+for+SOA%3A+Using+the+Web+for+Integration">interview Jim Webber and Ian Robinson on "REST for SOA: Using the Web for Integration"</a> - which I'm absolutely sure will be <em>a lot</em> of fun.</p>

<p>QCon, in case you didn't notice, just rocks.</p>
