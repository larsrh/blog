<p>Recently, <a href="http://pluralsight.com/blogs/dbox/archive/2005/02/20/6009.aspx">Don Box wondered</a> what would be the ideal programming language  for teaching kids to program. (See also <a href="http://lambda-the-ultimate.org/node/view/543">the LtU thread</a>, <a href="/blog/st/2005/02/22/teaching_kids_to_program.html">my own entry</a> on it and the comment left there, as well as <a href="http://www.1060.org/blogxter/entry?publicid=58B9573050952617BD6EC2C9A58A69FA&#38;token=">Steve&#8217;s quest</a> for the same thing).</p>

<p>I tried to find something specifically for the Mac (since our household is now mercifully Wintel-free), and came across <a href="http://www.alancsmith.co.uk/logo/index.html">Alan Smith&#8217;s ACSLogo</a>, a free Logo environment for the Mac, which is insanely great and exactly what I was looking for. Since I didn&#8217;t want to distract my son from the programming stuff by having to deal with a second new language, I got in touch with Alan asking for a localized version. It turned out that one was nearly done, which I helped finalize and which you can <a href="http://www.alancsmith.co.uk/logo/index.html">download for free</a>. </p>

<p>When I last programmed in Logo, I was about 11 years old, so I didn&#8217;t remember much about it (except for the turtle, which - due to the awkwardness of spelling &#8220;Schildkr&#246;te&#8221; in German - has become &#8220;Igel&#8221; (hedgehog) in the localized version); I was very pleasantly surprised to find out that it has very clear Scheme/Lisp roots.</p>

<p>In any case, ACSLogo is taking advantage of many of the Mac&#8217;s cool features; in fact, it even won <a href="http://press.oreilly.com/pub/pr/1116">an award</a> for it. I can&#8217;t imagine a better learning environment &#8212; it may be as good a reason to get a Mac as any.    </p>
