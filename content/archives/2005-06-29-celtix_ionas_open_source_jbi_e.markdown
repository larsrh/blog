<p>DUBLIN, IRELAND &#38; WALTHAM, MA, - June 20, 2005 - IONA&#174; Technologies (NASDAQ: IONA), a world leader in high-performance integration solutions for mission-critical IT environments, today announced the company&#8217;s intention to make available an open source Java Enterprise Service Bus (ESB). The project, named Celtix, will be hosted by ObjectWeb, an established and respected open source community with a focus on the development of industry-grade distributed middleware. IONA anticipates that the community will deliver an initial release of Celtix by the end of 2005, providing the industry with an open source Java ESB that can help drive adoption of Service Oriented Architecture (SOA)-based projects and promote the incremental adoption of this computing methodology in the enterprise.</p>
