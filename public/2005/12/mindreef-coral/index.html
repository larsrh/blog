<p>I don&#8217;t think he &#8220;demos&#8221; himself, but it sure can&#8217;t hurt to send him email &#8212; he seems very approachable to me.</p>

<p>·  The tool supports the use of variables for both passing in the input value (into the request XML) and storing the output value from the response XML.</p>

<p>·  The tool also facilitates passing of values from the Output and use it as input for the next cascading request (Eg: Output of Add User i.e. UserID can be stored in a variable and passed in the request of GetUser call.) This feature of the tool can be put to use for complete sanity checking of all interfaces of a particular web service.
·  On completion of the execution, the tool gives a report, indicating wheather a particular step has failed or passed. Further it is also possible to analyze the reason for failure of a partcular step in detail.</p>
