<p>A <em>very</em> cool <a href="http://www.infoq.com/articles/litescape-ip-telephone-casestudy">case study</a> at InfoQ:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This case study takes a look under the hood at Litescape&#8217;s software solution, guiding you from requirements through an architectural overview of their Java and .NET implementation, and then zooming in some interesting technical aspects of their project including phone integration with WebEx/LiveMeeting, integration between Java/.NET interop, HTTP vs. IPC communication between systems installed on the same machine, and over all lessons learned from the project.</p>
