<p>From <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/items/2005/10/21.html">Joel on Software</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The term Web 2.0 particularly bugs me. It&#8217;s not a real concept. It has no meaning. It&#8217;s a big, vague, nebulous cloud of pure architectural nothingness. When people use the term Web 2.0, I always feel a little bit stupider for the rest of the day. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Amen.</p>
