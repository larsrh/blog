<p><a href="http://ola-bini.blogspot.com/2008/05/new-hope-polyglotism.html">Ola Bini</a> again, this time on language choices:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A good programmer uses his common sense to provide the best value possible. That includes choosing the best language for the job. If Ruby allows you to provide functionality 5 times faster than the equivalent functionality with Java, you need to think about whether this is acceptable or not. On the one hand, Java has IDEs that make maintainability easier, but with the Ruby codebase you will end up maintaining a fifth of the size of the Java code base. Is that trade off acceptable? In some cases yes, in some cases no.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I couldn't agree more.</p>
