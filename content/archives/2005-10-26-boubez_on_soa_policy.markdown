<p>An interesting interview with <a href="http://www.layer7-tech.com/">Layer 7 Technology</a>&#8217;s CTO oufic Boubez (<a href="http://searchwebservices.techtarget.com/qna/0,289202,sid26_gci1136207,00.html">part 1</a>, <a href="http://searchwebservices.techtarget.com/qna/0,289202,sid26_gci1136544,00.html">part 2</a>):</p>

<blockquote>
<p>What has happened a lot in the last few years is that you have tools that allow you to write code, whether it&#8217;s Java, .NET, C#,and then click a button and generate WSDL out of your code, which is to me an abomination. How can you write an interface after you write the code for it?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I agree, even though I think it would be even better to avoid WSDL altogether: the further you move away from the old-style RPC-inspired Web services approach to SOA, the more you recognize how little value it provides in relation to its cost.</p>

<p>I&#8217;d have to disagree.  There can be a lot of value in using message-based web services, especially when you need to pass around large chunks of xml.</p>

<p>I think you misunderstood my comment: I was talking about WSDL, not SOA or message-based WS.</p>
