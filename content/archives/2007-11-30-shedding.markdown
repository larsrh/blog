<blockquote>
<p>Shedding is a technique <a href="http://pzf.fremantle.org/">Paul</a>, <a href="http://www.artima.com/weblogs/index.jsp?blogger=johnm">John</a>, and <a href="http://blog.skife.org/">I</a> hashed out (during the recent ApacheCon hackathon) for service lookup in pure HTTP. The problem it tries to solve is resolving where to make a request to if you have a URL, say http://storage.service/session which is a backend service for managing session state in Hypothetical Incorporated.</p>
