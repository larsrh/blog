There is one single thing that makes me still use IE on Windows, as much as I would like not to - it's the only browser that is embeddable in applications such as FeedDemon, SharpReader and others. That's a really powerful option, so perhaps it would be a great idea to write a decent COM interface to Mozilla or FireBird for the Win32 platforms.</p>
