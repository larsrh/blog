<p>Mac OS X comes with built-in spell checking for many applications, but why stop there? Now you can have an integrated thesaurus as well. With <a href="http://www.nisus.com/Thesaurus/">Nisus Thesaurus</a> you get a fast electronic thesaurus that automatically integrates with any service aware application including Nisus Writer Express, Mail, TextEdit, Safari, and more. </p>

<p>Very cool, indeed.</p>
