<blockquote>
<p>Going forward, XFire will merge with ObjectWeb&#8217;s Celtix team as the projects goals were found to be very similar.  The new project will be hosted at Apache and is called CeltiXfire (CXF). &#8220;For the XFire community it can be thought of as XFire 2.0.&#8221; CXF will include REST, WS-ReliableMessaging, and WS-Policy support.   Development on the project has already begun.</p>
