<p>I wondered why <a href="http://diveintomark.org">Mark Pilgrim</a> had changed his RSS feed to be XML 1.1, earning him the label &#8220;clueless user&#8221; <a href="http://www.cafeconleche.org/oldnews/news2004February7.html">from somebody</a> who usually knows his stuff. <a href="http://www.25hoursaday.com/weblog/CommentView.aspx?guid=f2cab0fb-fd13-4914-949f-580e8d9ed170">Now</a>  I understand.</p>
