	  <p>I'm still looking for the perfect news aggregator. Today, I downloaded a very impressive Java application, <a href="http://www.dynamicobjects.com/" title="dynamicobjects spaces">dynamicobjects spaces</a>. I was reluctant to do so, because I have not really seen many Java desktop apps that I like. But this one really looks great. <br />
Unfortunately, it doesn't work for me - I can't get the RSS subscriptions to work. I have emailed the author and look forward to his reply. Meanwhile, I'll take a look at other options.</p>

<p>There must be plenty of RSS readers that would deliver what you needed. </p>

<p>I use Sage which is a RSS and Atom lightweight news aggregator which is a Firefox plugin. It&#8217;s mediocre, but there is nothing fancy about a news feed to begin with, so it gets the job done.</p>

<p>What kind of fancy do-dads were you looking for in a news reader?</p>
