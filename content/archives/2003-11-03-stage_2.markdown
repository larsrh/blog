<p>It's going to take some time, but at least there is progress ... I made a mistake when I ordered the <a href="/blog/st/archives/000381.html">system</a>: I specified ELV (the so-called "Lastschriftverfahren") as the method of payment; this means that Apple directly transfers money from my bank account to theirs. What I didn't know is that they then wait for 5 days (!) to make sure I don't cancel the transfer &mdash; so if you want to get something fast from them (and I very much do), you're better of using a credit card for your purchase. Unfortunately, the only way to change the method of payment was to place a second order and cancel the first one. Anyway, I hope it's worth the wait ;-)</p>
