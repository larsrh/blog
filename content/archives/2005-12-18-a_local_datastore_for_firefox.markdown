<p><a href="http://www.sauria.com/blog/2005/12/13#1440">Cool stuff</a>, obviously demo&#8217;d at ApacheCon during Tim Bray&#8217;s keynote:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><a href="http://blogs.sun.com/roller/page/FrancoisOrsini?entry=derby_apachecon_demo">Francois</a> showed how you could use Derby as a local store for Firefox by talking to a copy of Derby via Firefox&#8217;s ability to talk to Java. His application was a simple tax app and he showed how you could fill in a form, quit (or crash) the browser and have that data returned to you when you restarted the web app.</p>
