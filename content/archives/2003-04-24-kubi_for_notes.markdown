<p>I downloaded and ran the installer for <a href="/blog/st/2003/04/kubi/" title="Random Stuff: Kubi">Kubi</a> for Lotus Notes. The result is truly amazing:<br />
Nothing happened at all.<br />
Zero. Nil. <br />
The last dialog in the installer mentioned that I should restart Notes and start using Kubi Client. I did the first, but there's nothing that would enable me to do the second. <br />
And there's nothing in my Windows startup menu, either.<br />
Not exactly encouraging ...</p>

<p>Sorry to hear of your bad experience with Kubi.  I&#8217;d be glad to help you get it going.  It&#8217;s probably something simple holding things up.</p>
