<blockquote>The European Space Agency (ESA) requested the Maison d'Ailleurs and the OURS Foundation to conduct a study on technologies and concepts found in Science Fiction, in order to obtain imaginative and innovative ideas potentially viable for long-term development by the European space sector. The study was concluded in late 2001, but identification of enabling technologies as well as advanced technological concepts is still ongoing. The Innovative Technologies from Science Fiction for Space Applications (<a href="http://www.itsf.org/">ITSF</a>) Web site and e-mail forum are devoted to the continuing discussion and development of this project. </blockquote>
