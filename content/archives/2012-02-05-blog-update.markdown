I took the opportunity of a 10-hour flight to finally re-import all of
my blog's old entries into Octopress, fiddling around with a
semi-automated process of Ruby and shell scripts and some creative
Emacs macros (check out <a href='/blog/st/archives/'>the archives</a>
if you care, even though I have no idea why you would). So if this
worked, all of the old stuff should be preserved, even though most of
it now only has historic value (and prevents Google searches to hit a
404). I've also taken the risk of moving the whole stuff back <a
href='/blog/st/'>to its old location</a>, and will redirect the
temporary one back once I'm sure everything works. One less excuse to
not take up blogging again ...
