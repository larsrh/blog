<blockquote>
<p>But this is just the beginning. There&#8217;s another, much bigger company that&#8217;s pissed me off lately by asking for another $29.95 more for a product I&#8217;d already paid for, just to support the new release of their own operating system. In this case, there&#8217;s no good open source alternative to this product; but I&#8217;m in a position to do something about that. After about a week of part time coding, I&#8217;ve already reimplemented more than half of their application, and I&#8217;ve added a couple of features they don&#8217;t have to boot. Very shortly I should be ready to kick the legs out from under their market. More on that next week.</p>
