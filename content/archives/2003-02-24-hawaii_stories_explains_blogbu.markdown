<p>I was a bit puzzled by the way titles are created when using <a href="http://blogbuddy.sourceforge.net/">blogBuddy</a> to post to a MovableType weblog. <a href="http://www.hawaiistories.com/archives/000054.shtml">Hawaii Stories</a> explains that it's actually the first five words that are turned into a title - a rather stupid decision, from my point of view. Anyway, it's a cool tool, and it's actually written in Delphi. Didn't even know that anybody used that anymore ;-)</p>
