<p>From a recent <a href="http://www.theserverside.com/home/thread.jsp?thread_id=22371" title="HiveMind Proposal to Join Apache Jakarta Project">thread on the TheServerSide</a>:</p>

<blockquote>Howard Lewis Ship (of Tapestry fame) has sent in a proposal to Apache for the HiveMind project, a simple framework for creating pluggable, configurable, reusable services. HiveMind has grown out of a donation to Apache from WebCT. It is a framework in a similar vein to the other lightweight containers out there, such as PicoContainer, Spring, and Avalon.</blockquote>

<p>I really like <a href="http://javatapestry.blogspot.com/">Howard Lewis Ship</a>&#8217;s <a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/tapestry/">Tapestry</a> web framework, which I very much prefer over <a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/struts/">Struts</a>, so this should be interesting to watch.</p>
