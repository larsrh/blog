<p>SAP AG has submitted <a href="http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=265">JSR 265: API for Utilizing Web Services Policy</a>. I can&#8217;t help but feeling that this is rather ridiculous:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This specification aims to standardize a basic framework in Java for utilizing the Web services constraints and capabilities. It enables other Java technologies for Web services to utilize policies in a uniform manner thereby strengthening Java as a competitive Web services platform.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Seems to me it would make sense to finalize, no, maybe even <em>submit existing specs to a standards body first</em> before standardizing programming APIs &#8230;</p>
