<p>Charles Oliver Nutter <a href="http://headius.blogspot.com/2007/09/end-is-near-for-mongrel.html">shows how to use Glassfish for Rails</a> instead of Mongrel. I have strong doubts many Rails applications will be converted to JRuby just because of this, but once hosting your Rails app in JRuby becomes a viable alternative to Mongrel, Lighttpd, FastCGI etc., it&#8217;ll really be done.</p>
