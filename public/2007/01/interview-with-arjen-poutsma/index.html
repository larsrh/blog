	  <blockquote><p>The <a href="http://www.springframework.org/">Spring framework</a> is very popular among Java developers as a more lightweight alternative to &#8220;enterprise&#8221; frameworks. One of the newest additions is the <a href="http://www.springframework.org/spring-ws">Spring Web Services</a> subproject, which according to the Web site &#8220;is focused on creating document-driven Web services [and] aims to facilitate contract-first SOAP service development, allowing for the creation of flexible web services using one of the many ways to manipulate XML payloads.&#8221;</p>

<p>InfoQ had a chance to talk to Spring web services creator <a href="http://blog.springframework.com/arjen/">Arjen Poutsma</a> about Web services in general and the Spring support in particular. Other topics covered include the reason for yet another WS framework, advantages of contract-first, document-driven Web services, JAX-WS, and REST.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="http://www.infoq.com/articles/arjen-poutsma-spring-ws">Read the interview at InfoQ</a>; if I were currently doing a Java Web services project, <a href="http://www.springframework.org/spring-ws">Spring Web Services</a> would be one of my first candidates.</p>
