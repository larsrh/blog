<p><a href="http://www.w3.org/Submission/2004/05/">This</a> is great news! I just hope finalizing a standard, er, recommendation will not take as long as it did with SOAP and WSDL &#8212; maybe not very likely since this time, there&#8217;s a <a href="http://www.w3.org/Submission/2004/SUBM-ws-messagedelivery-20040426/">second submission</a> to integrate.</p>
