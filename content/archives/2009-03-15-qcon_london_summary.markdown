<p>I&#8217;m too tired right now to write a longer post, but I can easily just quote <a href="http://olabini.com/blog/2009/03/qcon-london-summary/">Ola Bini</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If you haven&#8217;t visited QCon, I really think you should. It is really very good, and I&#8217;m privileged to have been asked to present there more than once. I always have a great time and I hope I will be able to continue to come back there.</p>
