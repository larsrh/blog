<p>I recently switched to <a href="http://www.yole.ru/projects/syndirella/">Syndirella</a> because SharpReader just kept on crashing on my system. It's not as nice, but works pretty well. Well, at least it used to ... for some reason or other, update all feeds (F5) stopped working, while a single refresh (i.e. selecting one source and then pressing Ctrl-F5) showed new posts.<br />
I exported my feeds into OPML, used Start->Run->"%APPDATA%" to go to the directory where Syndirella stores its data (at least on XP), erased the data file, restarted Syndirella - and it started working again. Hopefully it'll continue to do so for a bit longer now ...</p>
