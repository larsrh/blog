<p>Not exactly new anymore, still worth reading: <a href="http://staff.newtelligence.net/clemensv/PermaLink.aspx?guid=45606a61-10a0-4790-8938-be3c22787a35">Lightweight Transactions in the FABRIQ Pipeline</a> by <a href="http://staff.newtelligence.net/clemensv/">Clemens Vasters</a>.
A long time ago, I spent quite some time thinking about, and building, a framework that handled &#8220;logical&#8221; transactions &mdash; but this was in a very synchronous, RPC-oriented environment. Applying something similar to a message-oriented, pipelined system seems interesting &#8230;</p>
