<p>This weblog is powered by <a href="http://www.movabletype.org/" title="movabletype.org">MovableType</a>, an almost free weblogging system. </p>

<p>Almost free means that you need to pay a small fee (US$ 150) if you use it commercially, which I do. So my excuse for not having done so yet is that they explicitly allow for usage as long as one is undecided about whether to stick with it.</p>

<p>From my experience so far, I must say that I'm absolutely impressed - it seems to be a great system. Kudos to the developers!</p>
