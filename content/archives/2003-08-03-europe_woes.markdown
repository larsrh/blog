<p>From Apples iPhoto help: </p>
<blockquote>You can order a professionally printed, hardcover book of your album (available in the U.S. and Canada only), or print the pages of your book on your own color printer.</blockquote>
<p>Similar things are true for iNotes Music Store - no chance to use it if you're not in the U.S. or Canada. Does anybody at Apple care about this? It's a well-known fact that Apple Germany just sucks, so probably there's not that much pressure from this side. But it's sick, nevertheless. </p>
