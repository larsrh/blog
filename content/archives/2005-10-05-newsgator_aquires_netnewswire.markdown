<p><a href="http://ranchero.com/">Brent Simmons</a> sells NetNewsWire (my excellent RSS reader of choice) to NewsGator. I&#8217;m not so sure I&#8217;m happy about this, but I sure hope Brent got a shitload of money ;-)</p>

<p>I use FeedDeamon at work and NetNewsWire at home. So I like the idea of synchronising my feedlist and read-marks between both rss readers.
This however will only work if I subscribe to the NewsGator services and that depends on the price at the end.</p>
