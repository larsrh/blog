<p>I don't live in the US, so you could ask why I would care, but I have pretty strong opinions about <a href="http://www.downloads.thebluething.com/Flash_files/othermovies/bush-x-ray.swf">that guy</a> in the White House. Anyway, <a href="http://www.glassdog.com/archives/2004/09/06/a_fight_for_the_nations_soul.html">this essay</a> at  <a href="http://www.glassdog.com/">glassdog</a> makes me nod my head in violent agreement. I seriously don't see how anyone could vote for Bush.</p>

<p>With that, we return to our scheduled programming.</p>
