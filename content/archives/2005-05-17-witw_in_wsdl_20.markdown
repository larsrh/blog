<p><a href="http://www.pacificspirit.com/blog/2005/05/16/witw_wsdl_20_http_binding">Dave Orchard</a> does a WSDL 2.0 binding for <a href="http://norman.walsh.name/threads/nwn-whereintheworld">Norm Walsh&#8217;s Where in the World</a> application &#8212; without a doubt a lot cleaner than the (not really existent) WSDL 1.1 equivalent. Of course, Dave knows how to ask the right question:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If there&#8217;s a core concept to examine in REST description languages wrt WSDL, it&#8217;s whether WSDL&#8217;s aggregation of operations into interfaces and then binding to http makes sense.</p>
