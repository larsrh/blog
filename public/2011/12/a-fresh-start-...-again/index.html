	  <p>Google Reader&rsquo;s extremely weird behavior after a first attempt to move
<a href='/blog/st/'>my blog</a> to a new location has made me try
yet another different blog setup. This time, there should be
nothing at all left from the old installation, no redirects, different
URIs for everything, a new blog system &ndash; clearly, there&rsquo;s no way for
Google Reader to mess things up this time. Let that be the last thing
said about this mess; even though it&rsquo;s very sad to see all of those
blog followers go who only occasionally drop by whenever something new
appears in their Google Reader subscription, many of them may not have
been following anymore, anyway. Who knows. It&rsquo;s been a long time since
I spent some serious time blogging.</p>

<p>Which doesn&rsquo;t mean one can&rsquo;t restart, right? We&rsquo;ll see. For now, this
is the one and only blog I&rsquo;ll maintain. It has zero moving parts,
i.e. it&rsquo;s a static site, (currently) generated using
<a href="http://octopress.org/">Octopress</a>. If everything works as expected,
you&rsquo;ll be able to subcribe to the
<a href="http://www.innoq.com/blog/stilkov/atom.xml">an Atom</a> feed that should
actually be working for a change.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m somewhat undecided with regards to comments and the Twitter
integration (both in the sidebar as well as in the bottom of each
post). I&rsquo;ve toyed with the idea of doing away with comments
altogether, but I have to say that <a href="http://disqus.com/">Disqus</a> seems
quite smart.</p>
