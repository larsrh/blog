<p>Now, I have been deleting spam appearing as comments to my weblog at a regular basis, and while it's extremely annoying, it's not been a huge burden given the low volume. Some of the smarter spammers post something like "Great blog!" and hide what they are actually doing in the home URL they provide. But how stupid do you have to be to post a comment like dear Tom (a.k.a. grumni@seznam.cz) <a href="/blog/st/archives/000094.html" title="Random Stuff: File->Open URL">here</a> who is too fucking stupid to see that the HTML he writes doesn't appear here?</p>
