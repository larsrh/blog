<p><a href="http://www.intertwingly.net/blog/">Sam Ruby</a> <a href="http://www.intertwingly.net/blog/2005/08/25/Acts-As-Tree">continues</a> to explore <a href="http://www.ruby-lang.org/">Ruby</a>, this time showing how to persist entries retrieved from an Atom feed into a MySQL DB; <a href="http://intertwingly.net/stories/2005/08/25/load_blog_from_atom.rb">99 lines</a> including database creation, table setup and feed parsing! My favorite feature is the way Ruby enables you to add methods to existing classes (look for the <code>atomtext</code> method).</p>

<p>Not very much &#8212; Ruby is one of the programming languages that I maybe read a tutorial and one or two papers on, but never programmed in.</p>
