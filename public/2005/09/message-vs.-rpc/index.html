	  <p>As I&#8217;ve written <a href="/blog/st/2005/09/14/soa_and_web_services.html">before</a>, I spent two days last week on the SOA Days 2005 conference. Despite being the &#8220;Technology Conference&#8221;, it dealt much more with business issues than with technical aspects &#8212; which, in a way, is a good thing: I agree with the majority of the attendees that technology matters much less than having a convincing business case and getting the organizational aspects right.</p>

<p>One of the highlights for me was getting a chance to chat with <a href="http://www.iona.com/blogs/newcomer/">IONA&#8217;s Eric Newcomer</a> for an hour or so (he <a href="http://www.iona.com/blogs/newcomer/archives/000204.html">blogged</a> about the conference as well) &#8212; we had a nice discussion about RPC-style vs. message-style Web services, the importance of a service contract (specifically WSDL), dynamically and policy-driven message processing &#8230; what I learned, among other things, is that a) it&#8217;s not a good idea to get into an argument about the history of standards with Eric (unless you care to lose) and b) his views about the importance of message-level API access and the features of some of IONA&#8217;s products are not exactly in line, to say the least.</p>
