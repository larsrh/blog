<p>Found via <a href="http://www.decafbad.com/blog/tech/the_recipe_web.html">0xDECAFBAD</a>:
<a href="http://www.formatdata.com/recipeml/index.html">RecipeML</a> &mdash; The Recipe Markup Language (formerly known as DESSERT).
OK, stop laughing &mdash; this actually <em>does</em> make a lot of sense. Imagine that it&#8217;s Sunday, and you&#8217;re living in some of those God-forsaken countries, e.g. in Western Europe, where every shop is closed on the Lord&#8217;s day, and you only have, say, 5 ingredients &#8230; searching through all of the RecipeML-encoded recipes on the Web may turn up one or two things that you could actually eat.
Needless to say, another use case comes to mind immediately &mdash; just submit a SOAP-envelope-wrapped RecipeML document to your super-intelligent home-management system and watch it cook for you ;-)</p>
