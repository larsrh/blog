<p>Once again, discussions about the relative merits of Web Services,
SOA, SOAP, REST, and possibly MEST, have come up &#8212; and I&#8217;ve become so
used to it that I&#8217;m tempted to feel that <em>everyone</em> must have an opinion on this by
now.</p>

<p>This is, of course, totally wrong.</p>

<p>First of all, when a company or organization thinks about adopting SOA
&#8212; and I&#8217;m using this term in the broadest possible way, so broad that
it includes all of the approaches mentioned above - the <em>real</em> problems,
those that really matter, have got <em>nothing</em> to do with technology. I&#8217;ll
address this in more detail in another post; suffice it to say, for
now, that the willingness to open up closed applications, co-operate
with partners in a much more open way, accepting to be measured by the
actual business services one provides, and de-coupling monolithic organizational structures
poses a multitude of challenges that are much more business-related and social
than technical. So for a lot of people it&#8217;s much more important to
address those issues than care about details, such as the actual
software architecture they&#8217;ll use in the end.</p>

<p>But even if we talk about technology only, the REST-vs.-SOA debate is
not one that everyone is tired of. On the contrary, I&#8217;ve talked about
SOA to a lot of customers, partners and friends in the last few
months, and it&#8217;s fact that most of them don&#8217;t even know what REST is,
let alone are aware that there might be disagreement on a fundamental
level in the Web services space. It seems that when you start spending
too much time in the blogosphere and 90% of the blogs you read talk
about the same thing, citing and reciting and agreeing and disagreeing
with each other in much the same way all the time, it&#8217;s easy to
mistake this group for something representative of the general public.</p>

<p>So I thought it might make sense to address this topic in a way that&#8217;s
a little different from what I usually read: Instead of writing for
readers with intimate knowledge of the technologies, I&#8217;ll try to
explain my (rather personal) view on the state of the service world in
terms that are understandable for developers, software architects, and
IT managers who are reasonably up-to-date with the way software is
built, but have not yet <strike>wasted way too much of their
lives</strike> invested the time to study the relevant specs and
standards.</p>

<p>My plan is to roughly stick to the following structure:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="/blog/st/2005/04/17/soa_styles_part_i_overview.html">Overview</a></li>
<li><a href="/blog/st/2005/05/18/rpcstyle_web_services.html">RPC-style web services</a></li>
<li>Message-oriented web services</li>
<li>REST</li>
<li>Contracts and programming models</li>
<li>The great reunion</li>
</ul>

<p>In true weblogging style, I post this now without having any idea when
I&#8217;ll get around to actually doing it &#8212; nothing like putting a little
pressure on oneself &#8230;</p>
