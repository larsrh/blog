<p><a href="http://blogs.relevancellc.com/articles/2006/09/01/enterprise-impasse">Very nice explanation of the difference</a>; reminds me of <a href="http://www.itworld.com/App/650/nls_ebiz_masterfoodefines051115/index.html">Sean McGrath&#8217;s best piece ever</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;Think of your centralized database applications as a set of large rocks. Their great strength is their solidity. Their great weakness is their lack of flexibility. Think of spreadsheets as the water that flows over and around the rocks. Their great strength is their flexibility. Their great weakness is their lack of solidity. The easiest route to the far side of a rock is to be like water and flow over or around it, rather than to change the nature of the rock.&#8221;</p>
