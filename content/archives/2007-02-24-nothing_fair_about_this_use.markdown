<p>&#8220;<a href="http://www.sswug.org/">SSWUG.ORG</a>&#8221;, the &#8220;SQL Server Worldwide Users Group&#8221;, <a href="http://www.sswug.org/see/Interview_with_Sanjiva_Weerawarana__Debunking_REST_WS-*_Myths-32743">offers an article</a> &#8220;Interview with Sanjiva Weerawarana: Debunking REST/WS-* Myths&#8221;. To read it, you need to sign up and give them your credit card info (the 7 day trial is the minimal option).</p>

<p>Of course, this article is the one InfoQ ran <a href="http://www.infoq.com/articles/sanjiva-rest-myths">a week ago</a> &#8212; and the SSWUG does not even mention InfoQ as a source. IANAL, and I&#8217;ll leave legal action to others, but at least it&#8217;s pretty obvious <a href="http://www.sswug.org/about/">Mr. Stephen Wynkoop</a> is right:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Many people don&#8217;t immediately understand how we work, the services we offer and how to get the most from SSWUG.</p>

<p>Indeed.</p>
