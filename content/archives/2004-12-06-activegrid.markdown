<p>I have only spent about 10 seconds looking at <a href="http://www.activegrid.com/">ActiveGrid</a> (working on my weblog queue, I came across <a href="http://peteryared.blogspot.com/">Peter Yared&#8217;s blog</a> via a posting by <a href="http://www.looselycoupled.com/blog/lc00aa00074.html">Phil Wainwright</a>). I&#8217;m not sure whether <a href="http://www.looselycoupled.com/blog/lc00aa00074.html">J2EE is no longer required</a>, but this definitely merits a closer look.</p>
