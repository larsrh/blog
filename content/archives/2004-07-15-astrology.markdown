<p>Totally off-topic, but I just have to point to Charles Miller&#8217;s <a href="http://fishbowl.pastiche.org/2004/07/15/the_fault_dear_brutus_lies_not_in_our_stars_but_in_ourselves">final word on astrology</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If you honestly think that a human being&#8217;s personality or destiny is shaped by the fact that some guy looked up at a pattern of dots in the sky a few thousand years ago and thought &#8220;Ooh! Horsey!&#8221;, then I&#8217;m sorry, you&#8217;re an idiot.</p>
