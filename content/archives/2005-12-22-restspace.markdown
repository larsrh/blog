<p>Although I have never really used it in a &#8220;real&#8221; project, I agree with <a href="http://patricklogan.blogspot.com/2005/12/jinijavaspacesrio-and-jython.html">Patrick Logan</a> that JavaSpaces is a great technology that continues to be widely ignored for some reason. Which reminds me &#8212; whatever became of the idea of a RESTful XML Space? I can&#8217;t I seem to find a single implementation of this obvious idea, apart from <a href="http://xml.coverpages.org/tupleSpaces.html#Ruple">Ruple</a> (which seems to be quite dead)?</p>

<p>I can see it growing into something like this - but with it&#8217;s limited API (bulk and FTP upload only), I don&#8217;t it qualifies now &#8230; or does it?</p>

<p>Upload, download, search.  That&#8217;s enough in my books!</p>

<p>Amazing &#8230; anyway, I still haven&#8217;t found a solution for internal usage, which is strange. Maybe it&#8217;s too trivial to build to be interesting :-)</p>
