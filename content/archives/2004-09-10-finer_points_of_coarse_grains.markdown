<p>Scoble <a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0001011/2004/09/09.html#a8208">writes about</a> blogging strategies:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If you want a long-term presence on the net, it&#8217;s better to go on your own and have your own domain and control of your stuff. It&#8217;s more granular, but granularity makes for stronger communities longterm.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I agree, but noticed something totally unrelated to his argument &#8212; his use of &#8220;granular&#8221;. Maybe some of my readers who speak English natively can enlighten me: Isn&#8217;t &#8220;granular&#8221; neutral as to the size of the grains? Wouldn&#8217;t it have to be &#8220;fine granularity&#8221; as opposed to &#8220;coarse granularity&#8221;? Isn&#8217;t what Scoble means to say &#8220;it&#8217;s more fine grained, but &#8230;&#8221;?</p>

<p>Hey Stefan,
English seems to be a highly fluid language, especially when used in American business mode. &#8220;Move forward&#8221; has replaced &#8220;make progress&#8221; and the noun &#8220;leverage&#8221; has somehow become a verb. I suspect that &#8220;more granular&#8221; means &#8220;more coarsely grained&#8221; and those of us that speak un-American English will just have to transform those kind of phrases into whatever the equivalent in our locale is.

<p>Thanks, Jim &#8230; but if I look at his argument, wouldn&#8217;t it be sensible to assume that he means &#8220;more fine(ly) grained&#8221;? (Yet another question while we&#8217;re at it - grammatically, I see that it would have to be &#8220;coarsely grained&#8221; instead of &#8220;coarse grained&#8221;, although the latter seems to be a lot more common.</p>

<p>Granular is neutral to the size of the grains, but in general use &#8230; it&#8217;s hard to explain.</p>

<p>The closest I can explain is looking at granular as a continuum from &#8220;not granular&#8221; to &#8220;coarsely granular&#8221; to &#8220;finely granular&#8221;.  By saying &#8220;more&#8221;, it makes a comparison, either from not granular to somewhat or from somewhat to very.</p>

<p>By not using &#8220;finely grained&#8221; he&#8217;s either implying that the end result, while more granular, isn&#8217;t very granular, or he&#8217;s chopping out extra words - the &#8220;finely&#8221; in &#8220;finely grained&#8221; doesn&#8217;t add anything to the comparison, since it&#8217;s relative not absolute.</p>

<p>Or maybe I&#8217;m just over analyzing this.</p>

<p>I agree.  &#8220;Granular&#8221; means that something is broken up into grains.  &#8220;More granular&#8221; means that it has a greater degree of that quality, i.e. it is &#8220;more broken up into grains&#8221;, which is the same as having finer granularity.  At least that&#8217;s how it seems to me as an English speaker.</p>

<p>Thanks &#8212; that makes sense to me (sort of).</p>
