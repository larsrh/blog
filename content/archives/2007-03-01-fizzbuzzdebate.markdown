<p><a href="http://weblog.raganwald.com/2007/01/dont-overthink-fizzbuzz.html">Reg Braithwaite</a> posted a simple test for a programming interview, one that is simple enough to be used in an actual interview, and will expose those who apply for a programming job without being able to code <em>at all</em>. Based on experience gained with something like 200 people I&#8217;ve interviewed in the past 15 years, I can definitely support this as a good idea.</p>

<p><a href="http://burningbird.net/technology/perfect-example/">Shelley Powers disagrees</a>, rather inappropriately in my opinion &#8212; spending 20 minutes with Reg&#8217;s blog will tell you he&#8217;s a <em>very</em> smart person, and definitely not the kind of ignorant idiot Shelley seems to suggest.</p>

<p><a href="http://weblog.raganwald.com/2007/03/thank-you-for-writing-such-heartfelt.html">His answer</a> is just <em>brilliant</em>.</p>
