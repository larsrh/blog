Each fall, as I manually enter the entire Celtics season schedule, my company's holidays and my childrens' school calendars into my own personal calendar, I am again reminded how ridiculous it is that The Net has not yet ubiquitously embraced the everyday exchange of virtual objects so basic as calendars and as vCards - which can also likewise be subscribed-to, aggregated into Contact Lists and auto-updated via personal RSS feeds.  Bizarre.

<p>Very true. Having finally convinced my wife to use a computer, she still refuses to use it for managing her (and our family's) calendar. Being able to sync our private with my business dates, and maintaining a single vacation and birthday calendar, would be a good argument to convince her ... alas, I must be dreaming.</p>
