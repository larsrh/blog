<p>via <a href="http://www.intertwingly.net/blog/1553.html">Sam</a>:  Edd Dumbill has a nice <a href="http://usefulinc.com/edd/blog/2003/8/8#13:13">article  about RDF</a>. In passing, he makes a statement I'm in violent agreement with:</p>
<blockquote>
Others balk at RDF's use of XML namespaces. However, that's the standard way to get decentralized interoperability, just as with Java package naming. If you don't care about decentralized interoperability, it's hard to see how you can ever agree with web technology.
</blockquote>
<p>I'm completely puzzled by some people's reluctance to come to terms with namespaces - I really don't get it. Where's the problem? Some hint by those more experienced than I would be greatly appreciated.</p>
