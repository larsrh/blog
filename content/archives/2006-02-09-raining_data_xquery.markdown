<p><a href="http://www.pushtotest.com/thecohenblog/simpleblog_view">Frank Cohen</a>, now with <a href="http://www.rainingdata.com/">Raining Data</a>, has published <a href="http://www-128.ibm.com/developerworks/xml/library/x-accsoa/index.html?ca=drs-tp0606">an article about &#8220;FastSOA&#8221;</a> on IBM developerWorks, the essential idea being that instead of turning XML into Java objects that are persisted to a DB, you should use an XQuery datastore in the middle tier. </p>

<p>I took a look at the Raining Data stuff a few years back and found it pretty impressive, even though they didn&#8217;t yet have XQuery then. It&#8217;s probably worth a look (and the mid-tier cache gibberish is obviously only intended to calm down enterprise architects who would NEVER EVER trust their data to something other than an RDBMS ;-)</p>

<p>(Oh, and what&#8217;s with the names? &#8220;Raining Data&#8221;? &#8220;Tiger Logic&#8221;? Come on &#8230; you can&#8217;t be serious.)</p>
