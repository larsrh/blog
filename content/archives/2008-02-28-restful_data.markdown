<blockquote>
<p>he problem with that assertion is that it assumes coupling is a fixed constant — if you eliminate it from one point, whatever you’ve gotten rid of just has to pop up somewhere elsewhere, like some sort of strange “Conservation of Coupling” law. Of course, that’s not true. In my latest column, <a href="http://steve.vinoski.net/pdf/IEEE-Demystifying_RESTful_Data_Coupling.pdf">Demystifying RESTful Data Coupling</a> (PDF), I turn my attention to this claim and explain how RESTful data works, and why it too, like RESTful interfaces, reduces coupling when compared to WS-* and other similar approaches.</p>

<p>Very nice, as usual. </p>
