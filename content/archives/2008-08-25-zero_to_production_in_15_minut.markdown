<p>There still seems to be confusion about the relative simplicity or difficulty of deploying a Rails app using JRuby. Many folks still look around for the old tools and the old ways (Mongrel, generally), assuming that &#8220;all that app server stuff&#8221; is too complicated. I figured I&#8217;d post a quick walkthrough to show how easy it actually is, along with links to everything to get you started.</p>
