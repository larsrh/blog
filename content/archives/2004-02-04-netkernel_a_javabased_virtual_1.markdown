<p><a href="http://www.mnot.net/blog/2004/02/03/netkernel">Mark Nottingham</a> links to <a href="http://www.mnot.net/blog/2004/02/03/netkernel">NetKernel</a>. Quoting his quote:</p>

<blockquote>NetKernel is a Java-based virtual REST operating system for internet applications. NetKernel is a scalable microkernel which implements a modular REST abstraction in which all software components are URI addressable REST-services.</blockquote>

<p>That sounds very interesting indeed.</p>
