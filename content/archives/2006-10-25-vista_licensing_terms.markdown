<p>Via <a href="http://www.37signals.com/svn/posts/84-web-developers-microsoft-has-no-idea-whats-going-on">Sam Stephenson</a>, I learn about Vista&#8217;s licensing terms:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Parallels is an indispensable tool that lets us test our applications in all the browsers we support on a single computer. We can even test IE 6 and 7 side-by-side by running Windows XP in one VM and Vista in another. As a web developer, Parallels is easily the single best reason to own an Intel Mac. But starting with Vista&#8217;s release, Microsoft wants us to pay for the privilege: <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/documents/useterms/Windows%20Vista_Ultimate_English_9d10381d-6fa8-47c7-83b0-c53f722371fa.pdf">you&#8217;ll legally only be able to install the most expensive versions (Ultimate and Business) in a VM</a>, even if all you&#8217;re doing is clicking on things in IE.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Unbelievable.</p>
