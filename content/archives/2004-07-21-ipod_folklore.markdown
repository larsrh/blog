<p>A <a href="http://www.wired.com/news/mac/0,2125,64286,00.html">fascinating Wired article</a> about the birth of the iPod. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;The interesting thing about the iPod, is that since it started, it had 100 percent of Steve Jobs&#8217; time,&#8221; [&#8230;] [T]he iPod is louder than most MP3 players because Jobs is partly deaf, he said. &#8220;They drove the sound up so he could hear it.&#8221;</p>
