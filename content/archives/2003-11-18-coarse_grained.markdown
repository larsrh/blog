<p>I see that <a href="http://www.systinet.com">Systinet</a> CTO <a href="http://blum.typepad.com/coarsegrained/" title="coarsegrained">Adam Blum</a> has moved his weblog to TypePad, which is cool. Finally having subscribed now, this is definitely a weblog I&#8217;ll watch very closely. </p>

<p>If you have not yet seen it, it&#8217;s definitely worth a look - I have high hopes that there&#8217;ll be some very interesting discussions in the future about Adam&#8217;s views.</p>
