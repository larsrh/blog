<p>My favorite line comes from <a href="http://vowe.net/archives/006521.html">vowe</a> after he quoted this:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Sony&#8217;s controversial anti-piracy CD software has been labelled as spyware by Microsoft. The software giant said the XCP copy protection system counted as malicious software under the rules it uses to define what Windows should be protected against. It is planning to include detection and removal tools for XCP in its weekly update to its anti-spyware software.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>&#8220;You know you fucked up royally when Microsoft is one of the good guys.&#8221;</p>

<p>LOL!</p>
