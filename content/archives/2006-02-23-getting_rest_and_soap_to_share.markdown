<p><a href="http://jasonrbriggs.blogspot.com/">Jason R Briggs</a> has authored <a href="http://www.onjava.com/pub/a/onjava/2006/02/15/jython-soap-interface-to-rest.html">a nice article for onjava.com</a> showing how to build a REST+SOAP interface &#8212; i.e. support both, the argument being that even though you might consider REST to be better, management might require SOAP to be buzzword-compliant. I especially like his use of Jython &#8230;</p>

<p>I generally don&#8217;t believe that it&#8217;s a good idea to try to turn the REST vs. SOAP-debate into an implementation detail, but if that&#8217;s what you want, this is a very good start.</p>
