<p>In [&#8230;] this article I will show a class library that will create a proxy for a Web service specified in a WSDL (Web Services Description Language) file at runtime. Using this class library I am able to call many different Web services from the same application. I will also show a Windows application that will use the library to get information about a Web service and allow you to call it.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m not .NET developer, but I&#8217;m sure <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/webservices/default.aspx?pull=/library/en-us/dnvs05/html/CallWebServ.asp">this is an ingenious solution</a>. I can&#8217;t help, though, to consider it totally weird to dynamically generate a static proxy on the fly &#8230; what&#8217;s next, writing interpreted languages by compiling them into Java and then using reflection to invoke the methods? I must be missing something.</p>
