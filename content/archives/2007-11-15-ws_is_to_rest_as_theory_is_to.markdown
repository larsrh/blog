<blockquote>
<p>At this point I realize I&#8217;m flogging a dead horse. The folks I know from across the industry who have to build large scale Web services on the Web today at Google, Yahoo!, Facebook, Windows Live, Amazon, etc are using RESTful Web services. The only times I encounter someone with good things to say about WS-* is if it is their job to pimp these technologies or they have already &#8220;invested&#8221; in WS-* and want to defend that investment.</p>
