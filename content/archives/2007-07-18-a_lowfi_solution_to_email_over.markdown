<p><a href="http://www.mikeindustries.com/blog/archive/2007/07/fight-email-overload-with-sentences">Mike Davidson</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Every e-mail I send to anyone, regardless of subject or recipient, will be five sentences or less. Like a cinquain. Ideally, it would be a 160 character count like an SMS message, but since that would require an actual e-mail plug-in (viz. &#8220;work&#8221;), we&#8217;ll go with the much-easier-to-count concept of sentences instead.<br /><br />In order to politely explain the systematic brevity with a similar amount of brevity, I will link to a new site I just set up called <a href="http://five.sentenc.es/">five.sentenc.es</a> in my signature line. By ensuring that all e-mails I send out take the same amount of time to send (viz. &#8220;not a lot&#8221;), I am evening the playing field between emails and attending to many more of them in the end.</p>
