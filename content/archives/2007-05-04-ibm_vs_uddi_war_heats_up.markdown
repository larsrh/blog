<p><a href="http://apsblog.burtongroup.com/2007/04/ibm_vs_uddi_war.html">Anne Thomas Manes</a> (writing about IBM&#8217;s (lack of) support for UDDI):</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I can only assume that IBM supports standards only when it&#8217;s convenient for them to do so.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>On this occasion, I disagree &#8212; the sooner UDDI dies its well-deserved death, the better.</p>
