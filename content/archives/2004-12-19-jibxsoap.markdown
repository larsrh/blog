<p>I only just came across this interesting Web services framework, <a href="http://jibx.sourceforge.net/jibxsoap/">JibxSoap</a> &#8212; with a very promising attitude towards RPC and documents on the author&#8217;s side, as evidenced by this <a href="http://www.sosnoski.com/presents/cleansoap/index.html">very good presentation</a> on the current state of SOAP affairs. Note to certain partners of mine: Declining benchmarking options for your product is an unequivocally dumb idea.
