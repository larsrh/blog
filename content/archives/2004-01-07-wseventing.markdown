<p>Microsoft, BEA and TIBCO have published <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/webservices/default.aspx?pull=/library/en-us/dnglobspec/html/ws-eventing.asp">Web Services Eventing (WS-Eventing)</a> (what kind of word is &#8220;Eventing&#8221;? Oh, well):</p>

<blockquote>This specification defines a protocol for one Web service (called an &#8220;event sink&#8221;) to register interest (called a &#8220;subscription&#8221;) with another Web service (called an &#8220;event source&#8221;) in receiving messages about events (called &#8220;notifications&#8221;).</blockquote>

<p>The <a href="http://www.omg.org/cgi-bin/doc?formal/2002-08-04">CORBA Notification Service</a> gets reborn &#8230;</p>
