	  <p><a href="http://weblog.infoworld.com/udell/">Jon Udell</a> writes about <a href="http://weblog.infoworld.com/udell/categories/infoworld/2004/05/06.html#a990">Adobe Designer 6.0 </a>. I got a chance to take a look at it during a congress I went to yesterday. Very interesting indeed. It seemed to be what I would have liked Microsoft&#8217;s InfoPath to be &#8212; a way to design a form based on XML Schema, and then have a free client application to create instances of it (and either save or submit them to processing either via a plain HTTP POST or wrapped inside a SOAP envelope).</p>

<p>Another extremely interesting use-case was to use it as a means to create reports - design the outline, and merge it with XML data to create a PDF on the fly. The guy who demoed the beta was pretty unclear about licensing issues, though; I&#8217;m not sure whether this would require purchasing Adobe&#8217;s document server solution as well.</p>
