<blockquote>
<p>It&#8217;s true that the success of the web doesn&#8217;t reflect success on every aspect of RESTful web services, but the overlap is pretty large, and the web&#8217;s success certainly doesn&#8217;t stem from any systematic repudiation of RESTful principles.</p>

<p>+1. Regardless of the WS vs. SOAP discussion, I also claim that a Web application that&#8217;s built using following REST principles is <em>always</em> better than one violating it. Duh! you might say, and you&#8217;d be right; still, I don&#8217;t believe everyone agrees. In an interview I did with WS advocate Sanjiva Weerawarana, I asked him to concede at least this small point:</p>

<blockquote><b>InfoQ:</b> While it&#8217;s true that there are lots of non-RESTful usages of the Web out there, I don&#8217;t see how that reduces its value. Would you agree that a RESTful Web application, whether application-to-application or application-to-browser, is better than a non-RESTful one?<br /><br />
<b>SW:</b> No way; I&#8217;d never give it a carte blanche +1 like that! Better in what sense? Are you asking me to agree that having a fixed interface and moving all the interaction semantic understanding to media types is better for all scenarios? No, I don&#8217;t agree. There are definitely cases where that&#8217;s awesome (such as the Web), but there are other cases where that isn&#8217;t so hot.
