	  <p>Thought-provoking stuff from <a href="http://pluralsight.com/blogs/tewald/archive/2005/06/01/9680.aspx">Tim Ewald</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>All of this makes me think about a conversation I had with Jon Udell recently about the extent to which the phenomenon that is innovation on the Internet can be repurposed for use inside a company. Are the economics and politics (which a wit recently described to me as layers 8 and 9 of the OSI stack ;-) really the same? Are the technology choices really the same? Do you need Internet-style absolutely heterogenous systems inside a company, or is a somewhat more constrained environment possible? And should we be striving to build a single technology base to suite both worlds?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I think this is a very interesting question. Is the fact the &#8220;public Web&#8221; works so differently from what we do within a company&#8217;s closed boundaries a simple fact of life or a sign of a problem?</p>
