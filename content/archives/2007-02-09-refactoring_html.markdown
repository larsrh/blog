<p><a href="http://cafe.elharo.com/web/refactoring-html/my-next-book/">Elliotte Rusty Harold</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In this book I hope to help web designers, web authors, web programmers, and webmasters develop the tools and skills they need to clean up their sites so they can take them to the next level. The specific focus is going to be on converting sites to web standards: XHTML, CSS, and REST. Specific goals will include improving accessibility and usability, optimizing search engine placement, and reducing the overall cost of development for web sites.</p>
