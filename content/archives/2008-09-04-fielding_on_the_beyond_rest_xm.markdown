<p>Great post from <a href="http://roy.gbiv.com/untangled/2008/paper-tigers-and-hidden-dragons">Roy Fielding</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The point is that you donâ€™t need to change technologies (or even interaction styles) to solve a problem of information transfer efficiency. Sometimes you just need to rethink the problem. There are many systems for which a different architecture is far more efficient, just as XMPP is far more efficient than HTTP for something like group chat. Large-scale collaborative monitoring is not one of them.</p>

<p>I particularly like the 1kB image solution :-)</p>
