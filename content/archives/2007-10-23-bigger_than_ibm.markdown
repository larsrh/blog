<p>Another great <a href="http://fakesteve.blogspot.com/2007/10/its-official-were-bigger-than-ibm.html">Fake Steve</a> quote - LOL:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Unlike IBM, which used its monopoly and market power to abuse customers, we at Apple are using our monopoly and market power to make the world a better place. It&#8217;s just simpler when everyone can focus their attention on one vendor. As long as that vendor is not doing evil. Like us. And Google. Okay.</p>
