<p>Cedric Beust has some <a href="http://beust.com/weblog/archives/000044.html" title="Otaku, Cedric's weblog: Bertrand Meyer's interview">excellent comments</a> on a recent <a href="http://www.artima.com/intv/serious3.html" title="The Demand for Software Quality">interview with Bertrand Meyer</a>, who will obviously be trying to push Eiffel in 25 years with the same arguments he had 15 years ago.</p>
