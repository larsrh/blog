<p><a href="http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/rest-discuss/message/11960">Aristotle Pagaltzis</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
Conneg for language versions is a neat-sounding idea, but in
practice there are so many contradictory requirements, edge cases
and exceptional circumstances as to make it worthless. And where
it is employed there is frequently no painless way to get the
actually desired language version.
<br />
Just Say No.
<br />
Make the different language versions easily, cleanly addressable
and stick a bunch of flag icons on your page, then call it a day.
Your users will thank you and you will have less code to write
and debug.

<p>The flags <a href="http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/rest-discuss/message/892">are debatable</a>, but +1 to the rest.</p>
