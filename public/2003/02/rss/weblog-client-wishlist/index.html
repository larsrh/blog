	  <p>OK, So I'm trying out commercial software. NewzCrawler has an integrated (?) Blog client - so let's try if this works ... OK, I was able to post my weblog. It added a stupid "posted with line", but that's probably a limitation of the trial version. </p>

<p>Why do they do that? If I try out software, I can live with a nag screen; if I like it, I'll buy it. </p>

<p>Anyway, it didn't do anything obvious that FeedReader doesn't also do, and the Blog client looks nice but is not really integrated. What I'm looking for is this:</p>

<p>Something that combines my browser (be it IE or Netscape or Mozilla, I don't care) with a list of channels/newsfeeds, and allows me to select part of the text and with a single click add a link to the page, together with the selected text, to my weblog - allowing me to enter a title. It would be really cool if I could drag&drop texts from the browser windows, since that is the way I usually work: I google some subject, follow several links and links in those pages, and have a short history of about 5-10 pages that I'd like to add together to a single weblog entry.</p>
