<p>Via a comment in <a href="http://blog.jonudell.net/2008/04/02/parsing-human-written-date-and-time-information/">Jon Udell</a>'s blog, I came across <a href="http://www.rubyinside.com/chronic-natural-date-parsing-for-ruby-229.html">Chronic</a>, "a natural language (...) time and date parser written entirely in Ruby. It supports a staggering number of different ways of expressing the date and time." Very neat.</p>

<p>Well, Chronic is indeed a nice package; unless you have to work with European / German date formats. I submitted a feature request quite some time ago, but until now I have to use my little monkey patch to get it working (or at least to get the date part working).</p>

<p>Good point. Is that monkey patch of yours available for others too?</p>
