I’ve been an avid follower of Martin Fowler’s work ever since I read
[“Analysis Patterns”](https://books.google.de/books/about/Analysis_Patterns.html?id=4V8pZmpwmBYC&redir_esc=y) almost 20 years ago. I’ve always appreciated the
way he manages to distill complex topics down to their essence, and I
think the immense number of people reading [martinfowler.com](http://martinfowler.com) is well
deserved. I’m also lucky to have met Martin in person numerous times and was
thus able to discuss many of the topics we share an interest in with
him. 

Therefore I couldn’t be more pleased to have been able to publish
[my rebuttal](http://martinfowler.com/articles/dont-start-monolith.html) to [his latest piece](http://martinfowler.com/bliki/MonolithFirst.html) on Microservices over on his website.
