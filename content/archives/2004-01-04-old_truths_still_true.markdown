<p>I skimmed an old JavaSpaces book, and came across a reference to a paper I had recently searched for, but was unable to find because I couldn&#8217;t remember author(s) or title. It was the famous <a href="http://research.sun.com/techrep/1994/abstract-29.html">Note on Distributed Computing</a> from Jim Waldo et. al., dated 1994:</p>

<blockquote>There are fundamental differences between the interactions of distributed objects and the interactions of non-distributed objects. [&#8230;] Work in distributed object-oriented systems that is based on a model that ignores or denies these differences is doomed to failure, and could easily lead to an industry-wide rejection of the notion of distributed object-based systems.</blockquote>

<p>How true.</p>
