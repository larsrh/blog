The only reason for mentioning it is that the comments to it are very entertaining. I hereby declare <a href="http://www.intertwingly.net">Sam Ruby</a> my role model for blog conversations.</p>

<p>Just teasing.</p>

<p>Sam Ruby&#8217;s comment to Russ&#8217;s blog entry is very polite (unlike other comments, including those of Russ himself). He is offering his services. Maybe he&#8217;s looking for a business opportunity&#8230; Frankly, I didn&#8217;t know anything about Sam Ruby, and figured he&#8217;s be some kind of consultant, trying to sell something.</p>

<p>Well, meanwhile I looked up who Sam Ruby is, discovered that he lives in the same city as me (Raleigh, NC) and probably did not want to sell anything.</p>

<p>So, please forget my unqualified remark.</p>

<p>I see &#8230; yes, it would have been a nice sales pitch, as well. I usually try to avoid commenting on the ongoing Atom/RSS soap opera; it&#8217;s hard to grasp what&#8217;s going on without reading through a couple hundred blog postings and mailing list entries. In this particular case, I found Sam&#8217;s comment to be just about perfect - especially compared to Mark Pilgrim&#8217;s (although I hold both in extremely high regard from a technical perspective).</p>
