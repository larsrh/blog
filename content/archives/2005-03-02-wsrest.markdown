<p><a href="http://www.pacificspirit.com/blog/2005/03/01/wsrest_continued_do_we_need_an_http_transfer_soap_binding_and_simplified_wsdl">This proposal by Dave Orchard</a> seems to make an awful lot of sense to me. I can&#8217;t help but wondering whether the Web services world is not coming full circle to something that was available 5 years ago, though &#8230;</p>

<p>Hmm, I have to admit that I don&#8217;t &#8220;get&#8221; it. On the surface at least, it sounds like he&#8217;s frantically trying to preserve something - anything - from SOAP by trying to twist REST around and cram it into a SOAP framework.</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t understand what advantage the resulting chimera has when compared with straight REST.</p>

<p>I agree to a large degree, that&#8217;s what I meant with the full-circle part. There&#8217;s two advantages that can be gained IMO:</p>

<ol>
<li>Getting the WS-Folks to adopt REST without losing face</li>
<li>Getting the REST folks to adopt what&#8217;s good in WS-* without losing face </li>
</ol>
