<p>Applications are defined as networks of &#8220;black box&#8221; processes, which exchange data across predefined connections. These black box processes can be reconnected endlessly to form different applications without having to be changed internally. [&#8230;] The application developer works with flows of data, being processed asynchronously, rather than the conventional single hierarchy of sequential, procedural code.&#160;[&#8230;] Items travel from station to station, undergoing various transformations.&#160; Think of a soft drink bottling factory, where bottles are filled at one station, capped at the next and labelled at yet another one.&#160;</p>
