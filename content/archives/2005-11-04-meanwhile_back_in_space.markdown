<p>From Maciej Ceglowski&#8217;s <a href="http://www.idlewords.com/2005/10/meanwhile_back_in_space.htm">excellent article</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It is likely, therefore, that the next decade will open with a Space Chase (the inevitable name), as China attempts to develop a space program from scratch faster than the United States can dust off its forty-year-old blueprints. There&#8217;s something charmingly retro about it - a rematch of the great 1960&#8217;s battle of ideology, using refurbished 1960&#8217;s equipment. On pad 1, we have Red China, the not-so-Communist menace, flying a souped-up clone of the Soyuz; on pad 2, there&#8217;s the United States, returning to flight in a tricked-out version of the Apollo. There may even be a pad 3, some kind of unholy alliance of Europeans, Russians, and Objectivist billionaires, flying a composite rocket powered by the sheer force of the market.</p>
