<p>For some strange reason, my Eclipse 3.0 build has stopped working on Mac OS X: I can no longer create new projects &#8212; the &#8220;Next&#8221; and &#8220;Finish&#8221; buttons of the wizards never become available &#8230; I believe this probably has got to do with Apple&#8217;s JDK upgrade (to 1.4.2); I can&#8217;t seem to remember any other change I made to my configuration. </p>

<p>Needless to say, any hint would be greatly appreciated.</p>

<p><em>Update:</em> For whatever reason, it works if I append a space character to the project name, and then hit backspace.</p>
