<p>A <a href="http://bitworking.org/news/141/REST-Tips-Prefer-following-links-over-URI-construction">great post from Joe Gregorio</a> &#8212; my standard reference from now on to explain what <a href="http://rest.blueoxen.net/cgi-bin/wiki.pl?OpacityMythsDebunked">URI Opacity</a> actually means: It&#8217;s perfectly fine for your server to build meaningful URIs, following some sophisticated scheme &#8212; as long as the client doesn&#8217;t start building them.</p>
