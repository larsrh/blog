<p>I have a favor to ask, Stefan.  I apologize for using a comment to get through to you - your Godel, Escher comment is more than a propos so please forgive me. </p>

<p>I&#8217;m trying to STAMP OUT references to my old blog URL (hosted by radio.userland.com), and replace it with the identityblog.com address given above.  I really appreciate your link - could you update your blogroll to point to the new location?  Otherwise people finding me on google think I stopped blogging in November!</p>

<p>Thanks a lot.</p>
