<p>Hi Adriaan,</p>

<p>Given that Markdown works perfectly for me now, I was wondering about
whether it would be possible to include support for SmartyPants as
well?</p>

<p>On May 8, 2004, <a href="http://www.kung-foo.tv/ecto/">ecto 1.1.4</a> includes <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/smartypants/">SmartyPants</a> support. <em>That</em> is what I call support.</p>

<p>In case you&#8217;re wondering, ecto is the ultimate weblog authoring client for Mac OS X, although there seems to be a <a href="http://ecto.mineblogging.com/">Windows version</a> out now as well.</p>
