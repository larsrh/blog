<blockquote>
<p>Ruby is a dynamic programming language that, over the last few years, has enjoyed enormous popularity, thanks in part to the Rails web framework. Now with MacRuby, you can create Mac OS X applications with Ruby while maintaining the peformance benefits of a fully fledged Cocoa application. This article will show you how to get started with MacRuby and build your first sample application.</p>

<p>Interesting, including syntax extensions for Objective C's Smalltalk-style method names. </p>

<p>I&#8217;m pretty sure that that&#8217;s not MacRuby specific, but part of Ruby 1.9.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s in fact part of Ruby 1.9, it&#8217;s another syntax for hashes (initially intended to be named parameters) but together with Cocoa you get the style of named parameters that Objective-C already has. And that&#8217;s just neat. If there&#8217;s one thing that&#8217;s ugly about RubyCocoa as it is now, it&#8217;s method calls like insertItemWithTitle_action_keyEquivalent_atIndex_.</p>
