<p><a href="http://ferret.davebalmain.com/trac/">Ferret</a> is a soon-to-be-high-performance, full-featured text search engine library written entirely in pure Ruby (with an optional C extension). It is a full port of the <a href="http://lucene.apache.org/">Apache Lucene</a> Java project. [via <a href="http://kasparov.skife.org/blog/2005/10/22/">Brian McCallister</a>]</p>
