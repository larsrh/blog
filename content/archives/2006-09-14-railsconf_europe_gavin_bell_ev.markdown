<p><a href="http://takeoneonion.org/">Gavin Bell</a> and <a href="http://infovore.org/">Tom Armitage</a> gave a talk on the <a href="http://europe.railsconf.org/pages/abstracts#bell">patterns of interconnection</a> they found while creating the <a href="http://network.nature.com/boston/">Nature Network Boston</a>. This was really more of keynote-style thing, very interesting but hard to summarize while doing it justice. The two presenters had great slides and delivered it perfectly &#8212; very much recommended in case you get a chance to see them somewhere.</p>

<p>Update: Added links.</p>
