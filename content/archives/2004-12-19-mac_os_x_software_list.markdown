<p>Prompted by <a href="http://www.tagtraum.com">Hendrik</a>&#8217;s recent switch to a Mac (good boy!) I decided to compile a list of utilities, both commercial and free, that I use on Mac OS X. I&#8217;ve been wanting to do this for a long time, and this is as good a reason as any. If I manage to update this regularly, I&#8217;ll link to it from the front page. Note that I have at the moment not included any of the multitude of command line applications and libraries I use, as well as Microsoft Office or Lotus Notes (both in heavy usage here as well).</p>

<table>
<tr><td><img src="/blog/st/apps/images/Emacs.png" alt="Emacs logo" style="margin-right: 10px" width="64" /></td>
<td>Needless to say, <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/emacs.html">Emacs</a> is the most important application in use on my box. Recommending it to anybody is something I try to avoid at all costs, since the learning curve is steep and I don&#8217;t want to be the reason for people&#8217;s bitching. If you can take some pain, though, it&#8217;s definitely worth &#8216;getting&#8217; Emacs &#8212; you&#8217;ll never go back to anything else. You won&#8217;t even be tempted.</td>
</tr>
<tr><td><img src="/blog/st/apps/images/Quicksilver.png" alt="QuickSilver logo" style="margin-right: 10px" width="64" /></td>
<td><a href="http://quicksilver.blacktree.com/">Quicksilver</a> is the most useful and the most unusual OS X open source application I know. It&#8217;s an application launcher, and much more; every day, you can discover a new bunch of features that make your life easier. If you don&#8217;t use it yet, you&#8217;re missing something.</td>
</tr>
<tr><td><img src="/blog/st/apps/images/iTerm.png" alt="iTerm logo" style="margin-right: 10px" width="64" /></td>
<td>I&#8217;m a very heavy shell (bash) user: I much prefer doing a lot of file-related work here rather than using the Finder (or even PathFinder, see below). Combined with the <code>open</code> command, a semi-intelligent <code>find</code> beats most <a href="http://www.auditmypc.com/acronym/WIMP.asp">WIMP</a> actions you can think of. Apple&#8217;s Terminal.app is OK, but not great; <a href="http://iterm.sourceforge.net/">iTerm</a> (which is open source) adds a nice graphical touch (such as transparency) and a bunch of other useful features, like tabbed sub-windows. </td>
</tr>
<tr><td><img src="/blog/st/apps/images/NetNewsWire.png" alt="NetNewsWire logo" style="margin-right: 10px" width="64" /></td>
<td><a href="http://ranchero.com/netnewswire/">NetNewsWire</a> (or NNW, as most people call it) is a very decent RSS and Atom aggregator, with a very well though-out user interface. The developer, <a href="http://inessential.com/">Brent Simmons</a>, is extremely responsive to bug reports and suggestions, runs a very open beta program, and in general should serve as the role model for independent software developers. NNW, like many great Mac applications, is commercial. There is a free (as in beer) version, NNW Lite, but Brent definitely deserves that you purchase the professional version (which I did).</td>
</tr>
<tr><td><img src="/blog/st/apps/images/OmniGraffle.png" alt="OmniGraffle logo" style="margin-right: 10px" width="64" /></td>
<td><a href="http://www.omnigroup.com/applications/omnigraffle/">OmniGraffle</a>, from The Omni Group, is a superb grapics (or diagramming) software; you might call it Visio without the 80% of power features you never use anyway, but with a superb UI. I don&#8217;t think anybody else (besides, possibly, Apple) produces software that shows so well how cool OS X is. OmniGraffle comes bundled with Panther, IIRC, an upgrade to the commercial version is probably a good idea (although I haven&#8217;t done it yet). </td>
</tr>
<tr><td><img src="/blog/st/apps/images/ecto.png" alt="Ecto logo" style="margin-right: 10px" width="64" /></td>
<td><a href="http://ecto.kung-foo.tv/">Ecto</a> is <strong>the</strong> weblog editor for OS X; it&#8217;s totally, absolutely great. (This is one of the applications that, when Windows users watch me using it, makes them want to have a Mac.) It&#8217;s commercial, low-cost software, also done by a <a href="http://kung-foo.tv/">single developer</a>. Buy it.</td>
</tr>
<tr><td><img src="/blog/st/apps/images/Proteus.png" alt="Proteus logo" style="margin-right: 10px" width="64" /></td>
<td><a href="http://www.proteusx.com/">Proteus</a> is my multi-protocol IM client of choice; it&#8217;s commercial, again. After playing around with some alternatives, such as <a href="http://www.adiumx.com/">Adium</a>, I stuck with this one because it produced the least amount of problems. This might have changed in the meantime, though; since Adium is open source, it may well be worth a look again.</td>
</tr>
<tr><td><img src="/blog/st/apps/images/SSHKeychain.png" alt="SSH Keychain logo" style="margin-right: 10px" width="64" /></td>
<td>I don&#8217;t really know how it works, or what exactly it does, but <a href="http://www.sshkeychain.org/">SSHKeychain</a> prevents me from having to enter SSH passwords all the time. </td>
</tr>
<tr><td><img src="/blog/st/apps/images/camino.png" alt="Camino logo" style="margin-right: 10px" width="64" /></td>
<td>I mostly use Apple&#8217;s Safari, the browser that comes with the OS &#8212; it renders sites beautifully, and with Saft it&#8217;s extremely usable. But it&#8217;s nice to have an alternative browser around, and I much prefer <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/projects/camino/">Camino</a> (which has a Cocoa UI) to <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/products/firefox/">Firefox</a>. They share a rendering engine, so stuff that display correctly in Firefox works in Camino as well. Websites that can&#8217;t be viewed in either of them are not worth looking at, anyway.</td></tr>
<tr><td><img src="/blog/st/apps/images/Eclipse.png" alt="Eclipse logo" style="margin-right: 10px" width="64" /></td>
<td><a href="http://www.eclipse.org/">Eclipse</a> works very nicely on OS X; it doesn&#8217;t really feel that native, but then again, it doesn&#8217;t do that on any platform I know. I use it for the occasional Java stuff; if I were still developing heavily (which I don&#8217;t currently do), I&#8217;d take a look at <a href="http://www.jetbrains.com/idea/">IDEA</a> as well (last time I looked, it wasn&#8217;t that great on OS X.</td>
</tr>
<tr><td><img src="/blog/st/apps/images/CocoaMySQL.png" alt="CocoaMySQL logo" style="margin-right: 10px" width="64" /></td>
<td><a href="http://cocoamysql.sourceforge.net/">CocoaMySQL</a> is an app developer&#8217;s UI to MySQL; sometimes a little buggy, but very usable overall.</td>
</tr>
<tr><td><img src="/blog/st/apps/images/DrScheme.png" alt="DrScheme logo" style="margin-right: 10px" width="64" /></td>
<td>I wasn&#8217;t sure whether to include this, since I seldomly use it; still, Scheme is a great language, and <a href="http://www.drscheme.org/">DrScheme</a> is a great environment to learn it. And since I found it while scanning my app directory &#8230;</td></tr>
<tr><td><img src="/blog/st/apps/images/OmniDictionary.png" alt="OmniDictionary logo" style="margin-right: 10px" width="64" /></td>
<td><a href="http://www.omnigroup.com/applications/omnidictionary/">OmniDictionary</a> is a nice, small, free utility that does Dictionary lookups.</td></tr>
<tr><td><img src="/blog/st/apps/images/PathFinder.png" alt="PathFinder logo" style="margin-right: 10px" width="64" /></td>
<td>I bought <a href="http://www.cocoatech.com/pf.php">PathFinder</a> some time ago; it&#8217;s a more fully-featured replacement for the Finder. Although it&#8217;s definitely more useful, I found out that I don&#8217;t really use it that much. If you&#8217;re a mouse man (or woman), though, you should take a look at it.</td></tr>
