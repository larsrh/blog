<p>Microsoft&#8217;s <a href="http://spaces.msn.com/rayozzie/Blog/cns!FB3017FBB9B2E142!285.entry">Ray Ozzie introduced LiveClipboard</a>, a way to interact with structured data &#8212; a web developer can enable a page for copying and pasting of data to and from the clipboard, using microformats to provide structure and optionally update linked information via RSS. Very cool.</p>

<p>I also find it remarkable that all of the <a href="http://spaces.msn.com/editorial/rayozzie/demo/liveclip/screencast/liveclipdemo.html">demo screencasts</a> have been done using Firefox, and that everything has been put under a <a href="http://creativecommons.org/">CreativeCommons</a> license.</p>

<p>It seems that Microsoft actually gets it this time.</p>

<p>Naturally, this has been linked to all over the place; some examples:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.windley.com/archives/2006/03/ray_ozzies_clip.shtml">Phil Windley</a> had live coverage of Ray Ozzie&#8217;s keynote</li>
<li><a href="http://www.markbaker.ca/2002/09/Blog/2006/03/07#2006-03-microformat-cut-and-paste">Mark Baker wonders</a> about the proprietary wrapper</li>
<li><a href="http://dannyayers.com/archives/2006/03/08/web-clipboard/">Danny Ayers</a> links it to the Semantic Web</li>
<li><a href="http://www.1060.org/blogxter/entry?publicid=62552D0A7229D5FADD96DBC40A160F19">Steve Loughran</a> and friends seem to have a patent on web clipboards. I believe this is something different, and software patents are Evil anyway.</li>
</ul>
