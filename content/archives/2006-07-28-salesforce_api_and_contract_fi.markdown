<p><a href="http://www.bloglines.com/blog/sanjiva?id=152">Sanjiva Weerawarana</a> on the Salesforce API:  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The real problem is that whoever designed the Salesforce API was not smart enough to do contract-first design. The entire API is highly object-oriented, leading me to think that someone took a nasty class hierarchy and auto generated XML Schema and WSDL out of it. That&#8217;s ABSOLUTELY the wrong way to do it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I believe the Salesforce API was designed when doing code-first was considered to be the way to go. I obviously don&#8217;t really know, but I wonder whether Sanjiva would have expressed the same opinion two years ago.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s good to see a reasonable practice like contract-first become more and more accepted over time.</p>
