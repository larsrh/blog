	  <p>Good advice on HTTP app design from <a href="http://service-architecture.blogspot.com/2008/10/http-cache-and-need-for-cachability.html">unexpected sources</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>So HTTP Cache on its own doesn't make your application perform any better for end users or reduce the load on your servers. You have to design your application so the elements being returned are cachable in a way that will deliver performance improvements. For some applications its trivial, for others (like the Mandelbrot Map) its a little bit harder.</p>

<p>Steve seems smart enough, but pretending technology doesn&#8217;t matter in combination with making your business depend on services that aren&#8217;t inherently stable I doubt helps the bottom line (if the business itself isn&#8217;t stable and is in constant change how will business driven services not end up a mess?).  </p>

<p>I agree with your criticism of that particular (and many others) of Steve&#8217;s posts - as I said, unexpected source :-)</p>
