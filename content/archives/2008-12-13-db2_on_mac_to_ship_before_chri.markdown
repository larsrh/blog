<blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.ibm.com/software/data/db2/express/download.html?S_CMP=ECDDWW01&amp;S_TACT=ACDB201">DB2 Express-C</a> for Mac OS X Leopard will finally be shipping out (before Christmas), in all likelihood it could be as soon as early next week.</p>

<p>Smart move â€“ I don't expect anyone will actually <em>run</em> DB2 on a Mac for production, but it's obvious that the chance of developers using it increases significantly. I don't have any numbers, but I would assume that most Mac developers run their production systems on some flavor of Linux. </p>
