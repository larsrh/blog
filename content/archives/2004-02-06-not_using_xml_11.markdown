<p><a href="http://www.25hoursaday.com/weblog/PermaLink.aspx?guid=f2cab0fb-fd13-4914-949f-580e8d9ed170">Dare Obsanjo</a> has some strong statements about <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2004/REC-xml11-20040204/">XML 1.1</a>:</p>

<blockquote> XML is a lousy format for most of the things it is used for. The one benefit it has  is that it is widely supported and a guaranteed way to interoperate in a cross-platform  manner. By tampering with this the W3C is effectively diluting one of the few benefits  of using XML. This is an regrettable occurence. Unfortunately it looks like things  will get worse now that the W3C also wants to dabble in &#8220;binary XML&#8221;.</blockquote>

<p>I <a href="/blog/st/archives/000444.html">wholeheartedly</a> <a href="/blog/st/archives/000271.html">agree</a> with the statement about binary XML, and strongly suspect he is right about the rest as well &#8230;</p>
