<p>You may or may not have noticed that I have for about a month maintained &#8220;quicklinks&#8221; separately from my weblog&#8217;s main content. If you are viewing the <a href="/blog/st/">main page</a>, you&#8217;ll see them rendered to the right. I use the quicklinks to capture stuff I don&#8217;t want to (or don&#8217;t have the time to) write about in detail, and I have explicitly excluded them from all of the main feeds I provide so as not to bore regular readers to death with mindless link propagation.</p>

<p>In case you are interested in the stuff I stumble across during the day, you can now also subscribe to the <a href="/blog/st/quicklinks.rss">quicklink RSS feed</a> (only RSS 2.0, since nobody is picking up the main <a href="/blog/st/atom.xml">Atom feed</a> anyway right now).</p>
