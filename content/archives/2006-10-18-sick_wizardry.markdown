<p><a href="http://weblogs.java.net/blog/emcmanus/archive/2006/10/build_your_own.html">This post</a> from Eamonn McManus shows a seriously geeky approach to generating and loading Java (byte-)code on the fly. Ingenious, without a doubt &#8212; but it reminds me of Coplien&#8217;s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Advanced-C%2b%2b-Programming-Styles-Idioms/dp/0201548550/sr=8-1/qid=1161186962/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1/102-6473344-6596104?ie=UTF8">Advanced C++ Programming Styles and Idioms</a>: There&#8217;s a whole chapter in there that shows how to dynamically load code in C++. I happened to read the book (which is from 1991) when I was already using Java (in 1998, I think); I remember how happy I was that I didn&#8217;t have to actually use it anymore. James Robertson is right on: It might be wizardry, but <a href="http://www.cincomsmalltalk.com/blog/blogView?showComments=true&amp;entry=3338622442">productive</a>: no.</p>
