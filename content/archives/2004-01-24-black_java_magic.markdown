<p>Some <a href="http://www.jroller.com/page/cpurdy/20040123#yaul_trace">severe Java wizardry</a> described on <a href="http://www.jroller.com/page/cpurdy">Cameron Purdy&#8217;s blog</a> - very cool. I have to admit that I would have pronounced any programmer who suggested something like that utterly mad, but if it&#8217;s been built and actually works, you&#8217;ve got to admire it.</p>
