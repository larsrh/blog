<p>It seems there actually is an alternative to the visual Pipes! language, as mentioned in <a href="http://www.infoq.com/news/2009/02/Pipes-YQL-Jonathan-Trevor">this presentation</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>YQL is similar to Pipes but uses a textual textual language and can process both Yahoo web services data and any structured data with an URL. It has an SQL like syntax with three statements: SELECT, SHOW, DESC. This approach is more powerful and the applications created are protected.</p>
