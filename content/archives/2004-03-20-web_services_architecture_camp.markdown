<p><a href="http://schneider.blogspot.com/">Jeff Schneider</a> has <a href="http://schneider.blogspot.com/archives/2004_03_14_schneider_archive.html#107981038710707831">a great post</a> on what he calls the three camps when it comes to web service architectures &mdash; The SOA guys, The Bus guys, and The Protocol Network guys. I believe one category is missing: The REST guys, who basically believe the rest should stop inventing new stuff and use what&#8217;s available and actually has been working for quite some time.</p>
