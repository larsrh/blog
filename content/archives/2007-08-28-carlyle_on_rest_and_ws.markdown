<p><a href="http://soundadvice.id.au/blog/2007/08/27#rest-vs-ws-war">Benjamin Carlyle</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>WS-* proponents who see no value in REST are now a minority, even if some of those who accept REST&#8217;s value are only beginning to understand it (both REST, and its value). Moreover, I think that this will in the long run be seen as a battle between Object-Orientation and REST. That battle will be fought along similar lines to the battle between Structured Programming and Object-Orientation. [&#8230;] My view is that the REST vs Object-Orientation battle will end in the same way. I believe that REST architecture will be the successful style in large information systems consisting of separately-upgradable parts. I take the existing Web as evidence of this. It is already the way large-scale software architecture works. REST accommodates the fact that different parts of this architecture are controlled by different people and agencies. It deals with very old software and very new software exist in the same architecture. It codifies a combination of human and technical factors that make large-scale machine cooperation possible.</p>
