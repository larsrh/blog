Microsoft is pitching a Windows-only UI renderer that targets 2006-era desktops and notebooks, while allowing MSIE to stagnate.

<p><a href="http://www.adambosworth.net/archives/000012.html">Adam Bosworth</a> points out the analogy to InfoPath &mdash; paraphrased in my own words: A great idea, but not carried out in the right way.  I would never argue that Microsoft should do things differently for the greater good of the world &mdash; no company worth investing in would do anything that won't further their own goals. In these cases, though, I believe that they are actually ignoring a huge profit that could be made: Providing a development platform for modern, Web services-aware UIs that would be usable in an ubiquitous client, regardless of the platform.</p>
