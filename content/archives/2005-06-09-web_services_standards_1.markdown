<p><a href="http://www-106.ibm.com/developerworks/blogs/dw_blog_comments.jspa?blog=440&amp;entry=83355&amp;ca=drs-bl">Chris Ferris points</a> to the <a href="http://www-128.ibm.com/developerworks/webservices/standards/">web services portal page at IBM&#8217;s developerWorks</a> &#8212; nice, but we&#8217;ll probably continue to provide <a href="/soa/ws-standards/">our own</a>: with both IBM and Microsoft, there&#8217;s always a glaring omission of those standards they didn&#8217;t participate in ;-)</p>
