<p>Interesting thoughts from Richard Veryard on <a href="http://www.veryard.com/so/2005/02/straight-through-processing.htm">straight-through processing</a>. Sadly, most of the people writing about SOA and Web services (including yours truly) write way too much about technology and not nearly enough about the business aspects. Richard&#8217;s <a href="http://www.veryard.com/so/soapbox.htm">SOAPbox</a> is a great counter-example.</p>
