<p>I just carried a bunch of books to the cellar (which sadly is where I store them, since there is simply no place I could put them in the rest of the house). So while I&#8217;m at it, I might just as well quickly link to most of them (at least the English, non-technical ones). This the English-language fiction that I consumed in the last 6 months or so, with a super-fast review thrown in (where 1 star means <em>better spend your time surfing the web</em> and 5 stars mean <em>you will not stop reading even if you miss your own wedding</em>):</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0380720191">The List of Seven, Mark Frost </a> &#8212; very nice reading, with a very good sequel (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0688130925">The Six Messiahs)</a> as well, ****</li>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0679736646">Ubik, Philip K. Dick </a> &#8212; A classic, still masterful, ****</li>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/039915079X">The Teeth of the Tiger, * Tom Clancy</a> &#8212; I&#8217;m a big Clancy fan, but this one sucks very much. Maybe tolerable if you&#8217;re a George W. Bush supporter, *</li>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0679428895">Pompeii, Robert Harris</a> &#8212; Very nice, great research, grippingly told, ****</li>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/B0000AHRB0">Jackdaws, Ken Follett</a> &#8212; not exactly great literature, but easy to read in about a day, ***</li>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0812576403">The Light of Other Days, Arthur C. Clarke &#38; Stephen Baxter</a> &#8212; though-provoking, a bit strange; you probably could have made three or four novels contained in this one, and maybe it would have been better, ***</li>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/2266079999">Contact, Carl Sagan</a> &#8212; bought this after watching the movie, pretty good, ***</li>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0440241073">The Summons, John Grisham</a> &#8212; this one made me wonder why I bother buying Grisham novels any more, **</li>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0345404475">Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep, Philip K. Dick</a> &#8212; this is what <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0083658/">Blade Runner</a> is based upon, another masterpiece, ****</li>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0451210743">Hornet Flight, Ken Follett</a> &#8212; light reading, but pretty good, ***</li>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0060512806">Cryptonomicon, Neal Stephenson</a> &#8212; simply great, ****</li>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0671024728">The Second Angel, Philip Kerr</a> &#8212; highly recommended, intelligent stuff, ****</li>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0385504209">The DaVinci Code, Dan Brown</a> &#8212; almost embarrassing to admit to having read this (in about 2 days), this is pure trivia, but highly entertaining, ***</li>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0061015725">Prey, Michael Crichton</a> &#8212; great research, as always, but not great, ***</li>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0385510438">The Last Juror, John Grisham </a> &#8212; sort of a prequel to one of my favorite Grisham novels, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0440211727">A Time to Kill</a>; very enjoyable, ***</li>
