<p><a href="http://www.iona.com/blogs/vinoski/">Steve Vinosky</a> has published <a href="http://www.iona.com/blogs/vinoski/archives/000037.html">More Web Services Notifications</a> in IEEE&#8217;s Internet Computing Magazine. Excellent stuff, as usual.</p>

<p>Now, if Steve (or <a href="http://www.iona.com/blogs/newcomer/">Eric</a>) would only care to explain why we would need <a href="http://www.w3.org/Submission/ws-messagedelivery/">WS-MessageDelivery</a> (as an alternative to <a href="http://www.w3.org/Submission/ws-messagedelivery/">WS-Addressing</a>) &#8230;</p>
