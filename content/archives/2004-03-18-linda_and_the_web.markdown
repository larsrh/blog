<p><a href="http://www.markbaker.ca/2002/09/Blog/2004/03/16#2004-03-bray-sun">Mark Baker</a> believes that something very Linda-like &mdash; the World Wide Web &mdash; changed the world. I&#8217;ll assert that the Web changed the world, no problem. I fail to see how this claim is true, though, since I don&#8217;t particularly see the Linda (tuple spaces) approach <em>actually being used</em> in the way the Web is (mostly) used today.  </p>

<p>True, there&#8217;s the uniform interface idea, which is in action even when I use my web browser to buy a book at Amazon.com. I don&#8217;t see the spaces idea applied in program-to-program interaction very much, though. That&#8217;s not to say that it would be a bad idea, on the contrary. It&#8217;s just not this aspect that made the Web the success it is, IMO.</p>

<p>At least <a href="http://www.systinet.com">one vendor</a> is very heavily <a href="http://radovanjanecek.net/blog/archives/000065.html">moving in this direction</a>, though; I&#8217;m very curious in how this will work out.</p>
