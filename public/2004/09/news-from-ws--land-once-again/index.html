	  <p>The usual suspects, this time together with <a href="http://www.systinet.com">Systinet</a>, have released two new Web services specs: <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/dnglobspec/html/ws-enumeration.pdf">WS-Enumeration</a> and <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/dnglobspec/html/ws-transfer.pdf">WS-Transfer</a>. WS-Enumeration standardizes a pattern well-known from Distributed Object technologies, namely retrieving large result sets in chunks. Nice, but not that impressive &#8212; but maybe that&#8217;s a good thing: it essentially standardizes something that is known to work instead of inventing something on the fly.</p>

<p>WS-Transfer, IMO, is much more interesting &#8212; a REST-style set of uniform SOAP operations. I&#8217;m not sure yet whether the fact that HTTP POST has become CREATE is just a simple name change, or intended to show that this method is not intended for other uses &#8230; probably the spec authors were not so sure themselves.</p>
