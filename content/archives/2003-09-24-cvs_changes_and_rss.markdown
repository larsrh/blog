<p><a href="http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/">Tim Bray</a> writes about using an RSS newsfeed generated from CVS for <a href="http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2003/09/24/DocSub" title="ongoing Â· Subscribing to a Document">Subscribing to a Document</a>. This is such an obvious idea, I wonder why I have not come across it (or thought about it myself) before. Combining this with a simple HTML rendering of the changes - perhaps by embedding a stylesheet link in the RSS itself - would allow people to blog about (and reference) particular changes, to a document or source file, either in public or in corporate blogs.</p>
