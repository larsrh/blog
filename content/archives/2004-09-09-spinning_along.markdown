<p>An interesting <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2004/09/09/ms_capgemini_newham_report/">article</a> at <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/">The Register</a> about Microsoft putting its spin on a pseudo-independent case study which examined the cost benefits of Windows vs. OSS/Linux. </p>

<p>I&#8217;m not religious or zealous about Microsoft products; I think the folks from Redmond produce usually good, and sometimes even excellent software. But I plainly can&#8217;t imagine anyone being serious would need to think for more than 10 seconds about whether the average institution or company saves money by moving to Linux/OpenOffice as opposed to Windows/MS Office.</p>
