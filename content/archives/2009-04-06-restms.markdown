<p>I didn't spend enough time with it yet to have an opinion, but at first glance this looks <a href="http://wiki.amqp.org/spec:7">very interesting</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This document describes RestMS, a RESTful Messaging Service that exposes AMQP networks as a set of resources clearly identified by URIs and each supporting the appropriate HTTP methods. RestMS is designed to interoperate with AMQP/0.9.1 and future versions of AMQP.</p>
