<p>What do you have to call this service stuff to be hip these days? <a href="http://www.25hoursaday.com/weblog/PermaLink.aspx?guid=34ee2f3a-67ae-410d-8530-56cf5bbab48f">Several</a> <a href="http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2004/05/31/SOATalk">people</a> <a href="http://skonnard.com/archive/2004/05/24/368.aspx">have</a> <a href="http://radovanjanecek.net/blog/archives/000100.html">thoughts</a> on the topic &#8230; my take is that you can have an SOA (yes, I think there is something like that) only on the enterprise level. While you can build individual applications in a service-oriented way, that alone doesn&#8217;t magically introduce an SOA to your company.</p>
