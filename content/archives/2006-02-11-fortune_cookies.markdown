<blockquote>
<p>A box of X-rated fortune cookies was mistakenly delivered to a fundraiser hosted by a Brooklyn politician. <br />The 350 cookies stuffed with &#8220;the most graphically lurid&#8221; fortunes got mixed up in a batch of 1,750 cookies ordered for the Chinese New Year event, Borough President Marty Markowitz said Friday. Some guests &#8220;were stunned, to say the least.&#8221;</p>
