<p><a href="http://www.orablogs.com/pavlik/archives/000783.html">Yet another good discussion</a> of the problems with JAX-RPC-like approaches to Web services. I wonder, though: If you use the classes in <code>javax.xml.soap</code> package &#8212; I&#8217;m talking about <code>SOAPElement</code>, <code>SOAPBody</code> etc. &#8212; what&#8217;s the technically correct way to refer to those? JAX-RPC? SAAJ?</p>

<p>I bet whoever came up with the idea to name this spec JAX-RPC deeply regrets this.</p>
