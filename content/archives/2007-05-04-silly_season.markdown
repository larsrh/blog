<blockquote>
<p>At some point, you just have to give up on virgins. Y&#8217;all have fun. Play with your vendor-specific runtimes. Don&#8217;t call me when you wake up one morning with a pink line in the round window and your BFF vendor won&#8217;t return your calls. If you need me (but of course you won&#8217;t), I&#8217;ll be holed up in my drab unpainted toolshed around the corner, quietly building applications on the web that work.</p>
