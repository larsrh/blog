<p>Or someone like <a href="http://www.drunkenblog.com/">DrunkenBlog</a>&#8217;s Michael Bell might take some time and write <a href="http://www.drunkenblog.com/drunkenblog-archives/000534.html">a few words</a> to make sure that there&#8217;s no excuse in the world left for you. Seriously, what a brilliant piece of investigative journalism &#8212; way too good and detailed for any newspaper or magazine. Even if you&#8217;ve never heard of CherryOS before, this is definitely worth a read.</p>
