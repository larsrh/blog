<p><a href="http://blog.hibernate.org">Gavin King</a>, maintainer of Hibernate and member of the EJB 3.0 Expert Group, <a href="http://blog.hibernate.org/cgi-bin/blosxom.cgi/2004/05/07#ejb3">writes about</a> some of EJB 3.0&#8217;s designated features. Sounds reasonable to me, and shows that isolating your business domain information from technical implementations <a href="/blog/st/2003/07/mda_from_a_developers_perspective.html">still is a good idea</a>.</p>
