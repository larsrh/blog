<p><a href="http://blog.springsource.com/2009/03/08/rest-in-spring-3-mvc/">Arjen Poutsma</a> on REST support in Spring MVC 3.0:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In the last couple of years, REST has emerged as a compelling alternative to SOAP/WSDL/WS-*-based distributed architectures. So when we started to plan our work on the next major release of Spring - version 3.0, it was quite clear to us that we had to focus on making the development of &#8216;RESTful&#8217; Web services and applications easier.</p>

<p>I think it&#8217;s great to see REST support appear where it belongs â€“ in the Web framework.</p>
