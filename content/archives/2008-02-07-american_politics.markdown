<p>As usual, I am puzzled by American politics &#8212; from a European view, or at least from my very personal German view, there is simply no question at all that <a href="http://lessig.org/blog/2008/02/20_minutes_or_so_on_why_i_am_4.html">this guy is the right one</a>. How could anybody compete?</p>

<p>In all probability, this means he&#8217;ll lose, because my wishes for American elections never seem to come true. (What can you expect from a population that elects George W. Bush? <em>Twice?</em>) </p>

<p>Well, technically he was only elected once. But, yes, even that was one time too many.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s interesting to know that Hillary has never been popular with Americans.  The main argument for her is experience, and actually the fact that she IS part of the system!  She is a political veteran with connections, therefore she can be effective in the current system and is therefore the &#8220;safe democratic choice&#8221;.</p>

<p>Barack is very ambitious in his goal to change America.  I am sure many Americans would like this change, but sadly don&#8217;t consider it doable, at least not right now.  They fear that he is naive in his ambitions.  They&#8217;d rather have a veteran steer them out of this crisis than a visionary with a high probability of failure (at least from a subjective point of view).</p>
