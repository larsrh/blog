<blockquote>
<p>What is needed is some way to increase the methods people can have to trust information I state. Here I describe how one can use cryptography to increase that trust level. Starting from my creation of a PGP key, I show how I can describe my public signature in my foaf file, used PGP to sign that file and then link to the signature so that people can detect a tampered file. From this basis I show how one can build a very solid cryptographically enhanced web of trust.</p>
