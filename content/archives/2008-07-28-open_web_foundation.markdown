<p><a href="http://www.25hoursaday.com/weblog/2008/07/26/SomeThoughtsOnTheOpenWebFoundation.aspx">Dare Obasanjo</a> on the newly created <a href="http://openwebfoundation.org/">Open Web Foundation</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I can understand that a bunch of kids fresh out of college are ignorant of the IETF and believe they have to reinvent the wheel to Save the Open Web but I am surprised that Google which has had several of it&#8217;s employees participate in the IETF processes which created RFC 4287, RFC 4959, RFC 5023 and RFC 5034 would join in this behavior. Why would Google decide to sponsor a separate standards organization that competes with the IETF that has less inclusive processes than the IETF, no clear idea of how corporate sponsorship will work and a yet to be determined IPR policy?</p>

<p>Hi Stefan,</p>

<p>You may also want to check out <a href="http://friendfeed.com/e/b75fcff5-b56d-5c9a-f87d-2758d17f5825/Some-Thoughts-on-the-Open-Web-Foundation/" rel="nofollow">this thread on FriendFeed</a>, and the <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/open-web-discuss" rel="nofollow">public discussion group</a>.  There are a number of inaccuracies in Dare&#8217;s post that we&#8217;ve tried to clear up, particularly around relationship between the OWF and standards organizations.  (There are a lot of IETF supporters and contributors among us, for one thing.)   I hope that people take a moment to learn more before jumping to a conclusion.</p>

<p>Cheers,</p>

<p>-DeWitt</p>

<p>Hi DeWitt, I still share Dare&#8217;s doubts (although I&#8217;m maybe not as radical in my opinion as he is). But if I look at the post from Eran Hammer-Lahav <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/open-web-discuss/browse_thread/thread/576ea899c893c18c">in this thread</a> it seems that it&#8217;s indeed the IETF process you folks are unhappy with, and you are looking to create a competing organization. Which would be a bad thing, from my POV, as a) we have enough standards bodies already and b) the work produced by IETF, in my humble opinion, is pretty great.</p>

<p>um, OWF is pretty embryonic, but  if it allows shaven mortals to openly publish specs at stable URIs in HTML/ UTF-8 with clear IPR process and without flying to  attend BOF meetings, then I&#8217;m all for it.</p>
