<p><a href="http://www.dynamicobjects.com/d2r/">Diego Doval</a> takes a <a href="http://www.dynamicobjects.com/d2r/archives/002430.html">a walk down memory lane</a> and looks at Microsoft&#8217;s history of past announcements and real products. Though probably similar stories could be told about almost any other vendor as well, it&#8217;s still very interesting. </p>

<p>Whatever Longhorn will look like when it finally ships, it very likely will be a lot different than what we&#8217;re led to expect now.</p>
