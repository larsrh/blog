<p><a href="http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/17aa89d0-500b-11dc-a6b0-0000779fd2ac.html">Unbelievable</a> (emphasis mine):</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Apple has succeeded in committing European mobile phone operators that want exclusively to sell its new iPhone to share parts of their revenues with the technology group.<br /><br />The contract, which was signed by three European mobile operators in recent days, <em>requires that the operators hand over to Apple 10 per cent of the revenues made from calls and data transfers by customers over iPhones</em>. The contract was signed by T-Mobile of Germany, Orange of France and O2 in the UK.</p>
