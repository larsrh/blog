<blockquote>
<p>In addition, it is not very often that you can be part of a team that aspires to radically change the dynamics of building a new language, to the extent that a developer can write their own model-driven language in a straightforward way while getting all the language services (Intellisense, colorization, etc.) for “free”.</p>

<p>Sounds a lot like <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/gmt/oaw/doc/4.2/html/contents/xtext_reference.html">Xtext</a> to me …</p>

<p>Hi Stefan,</p>

<p>My guess is that it&#8217;s SmallTalk model style over CLR. Think of an interactive model, with good ol &#8216;Pane being represented by XAML. Data == Code and all that. Intriguing stuff, and I&#8217;m glad they are moving forward - feels like forever that those guys (DBox et al) have been head-down on this.</p>
