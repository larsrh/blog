<p>I&#8217;d heard about this skit 25 or so years ago when a drunk German friend decided to reenact the whole sketch in the local pub. Given the sketch is completely unknown in England. After failing to raise a single smile poor old Horst was left as puzzled as his audience - &#8220;but, but it&#8217;s a British sketch, it&#8217;s famous&#8221;! Now, at last, I can see what the fuss was about ;-)</p>
