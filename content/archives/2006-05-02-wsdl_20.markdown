<p>SearchWebServices.com has an article about the upcoming WS-I Basic Profile updates. I find this especially interesting:</p>

<blockquote>
Basic Profile 2.0 will incorporate the following specs:
<ul>
<li>W3C WS-Addressing 1.0 Core</li>
<li>W3C WS-Addressing 1.0 SOAP Binding</li>
<li>W3C WS-Addressing 1.0 WSDL Binding</li>
<li>W3C SOAP Version 1.2 Part 1: Messaging Framework, and Part 2: Adjuncts</li>
<li>W3C Message Transmission Optimization Method (MTOM)</li>
<li>W3C XML-binary Optimized Packaging</li>
<li>W3C Namespaces in XML</li>
<li>W3C XML 1.0 Second Edition</li>
<li>W3C WSDL 1.1</li>
<li>W3C XML Schema 2001 Part 1: Structures, and Part 2: Datatypes</li>
<li>OASIS UDDI 2 and UDDI 3</li>
<li>WSDL 1.1 Binding Extension for SOAP 1.2</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<p>Very suspiciously missing from this list is WSDL 2.0 &#8230;</p>

<p>Well, the role of WS-I is to &#8216;clean up after the parade&#8217; and there has to be a high level of concensus on the WS-I board to agree upon such work - all of the other specs are W3C Recommendations (or as good as), WSDL 2.0 is still in CR and still has yet to march past in glory :-) </p>

<p>I have to wonder who will do this work, participation in the WS-I hasn&#8217;t been great of late.</p>
