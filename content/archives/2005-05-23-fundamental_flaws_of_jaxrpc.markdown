<p>From <a href="http://www.1060.org/blogxter/entry?publicid=FA0DC57CFB40FB1F2F9EE919DA6BACEF">this paper</a> by <a href="http://www.1060.org/blogxter/publish/5">Steve Loughran</a> and Edmund Smith:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This paper examines the current SOAP APIs in Java, and in particular the
Java API for XML-based RPC, commonly known as JAX-RPC, which is
effectively the standard API for SOAP on the Java platform. We claim
that JAX-RPC, and indeed any SOAP API that relies upon a perfect two-
way mapping between XML data and native language objects is
fundamentally flawed. Furthermore, we claim that the attempt JAX-RPC
makes to extend the remote method invocation metaphor to SOAP
services is counterproductive.</p>

<p>+1 +1 +1. I&#8217;ve rarely read a paper I could so thoroughly agree with &#8212; I hope Alpine is going to be huge success!</p>
