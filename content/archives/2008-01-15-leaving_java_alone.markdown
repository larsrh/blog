<blockquote>
<p>Here&#8217;s a thought: Let&#8217;s leave Java where it is, and just start creating new JVM languages that cater to specific needs. You can call them Java, too, if you like. Or something else, like Scala or Clojure or Groovy or JRuby or CJ or whatever suits your fancy. Since everybody compiles down to JVM bytecode, it&#8217;s all really academic&#8212;they&#8217;re all Java, in some fundamental way. Which means that Java can thus rest easy, knowing that it fought the good fight, and that others equally capable are carrying on the tradition of JVM programming.</p>

<p>I couldn&#8217;t agree more.</p>
