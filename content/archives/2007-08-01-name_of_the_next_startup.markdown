<p><a href="http://romanstanek.blogspot.com/2007/07/name-of-next-startup.html">Roman Stanek</a>, founder and ex-CEO of <a href="http://www.systinet.com/">Systinet</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I thought long and hard about the name for my next company and I was not sure whether to call it Datr.com or Zetr.com. But then I came up with a non-Web 2.0 name with plenty of vowels. And therefore as of today I&#8217;ve become the Founder and CEO of <a href="http://gooddata.com/">Good Data Corporation</a>.</p>
