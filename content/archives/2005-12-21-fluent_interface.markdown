<p>Martin Fowler always manages to come up with catchy terms for well-known things &#8212; <a href="http://martinfowler.com/bliki/FluentInterface.html">this time is no exception</a>. I used to design APIs in this style in C++, but dropped the convention in Java to be more in line with common design practices (JavaBeans and all). Still, interesting to see the connection to domain-specific languages mentioned here.</p>
