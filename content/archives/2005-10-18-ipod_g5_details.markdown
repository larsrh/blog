<p>I wonder how long I&#8217;ll be able to resist buying the new shiny 60GB variant. Maybe even black, to match my car&#8217;s color &#8230; I wonder whether it has black earphones? <a href="http://www.ilounge.com/index.php/articles/comments/top-ten-things-you-wanted-to-know-about-the-5g-ipod/">Useful details here</a>.</p>

<p>the black ipod nano unfortunately comes with white ones&#8230; looks a little strange.</p>

<p>more to the point, why does anyone use the crappy apple earplugs? for less than $100 you can get a pair of stellar audiophile-quality headphones (the difference in sound quality is apparent to anyone), and for serious workouts i prefer the sony sports walkman headphone (the headband is essential for keeping the phones on your head without having to jam earbuds in deep).</p>

<p>White earpods must look very strange &#8230; I took a look at different high-end earphones, most of them are of the in-ear type, which I simply can&#8217;t stand. I tried out a Sony model and even bought the Apple in-ear variant, and not only were they uncomfortable, I also found the sound horrible. Maybe something&#8217;s wrong with my ears anatomically :-)</p>
