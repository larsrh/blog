<p>From <a href="http://biz.yahoo.com/prnews/061009/sfm093.html?.v=64">a salesforce.com press release</a>, via <a href="http://patricklogan.blogspot.com/2006/10/apex.html">Patrick Logan</a>: </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Apex will empower customers, partners and developers with the same language and platform that have allowed salesforce.com to build its industry-leading on-demand service. Apex code and applications will run on salesforce.com&#8217;s service, freeing businesses for the first time from the burden of buying and deploying complex software infrastructure. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#8217;ve not yet made up my mind whether this is brilliant or stupid. <a href="http://www.salesforce.com/landing/apex_the_basics.jsp">The language</a> definitely doesn&#8217;t look like it deserves to be loved.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m looking into this APEX Language and trying to determine the marketplace acceptance and if there are any niche products, programs or third party data points not related to SFC out there.  Any little bit helps.</p>

<p>thanks - jimmyp</p>
