<p><a href="http://blogs.gartner.com/nick_gall/">Nick Gall</a> in a comment over at <a href="http://stage.vambenepe.com/archives/447">William Vambenepe's blog</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>What’s truly ironic here is that virtually every manageable device these days has a built-in minimal web server enabling it to be managed via http and virtually none have built-in support for the WS-* stack. Yet WS-Management wants to use the WS-* stack as the basis for systems management. I just don’t get it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I have to agree: it seems totally absurd to me to base a device management protocol on WS-*. Even though I don't believe in the arguments made for favoring WS-* over HTTP in enterprise scenarios, it makes even less sense here.</p>
