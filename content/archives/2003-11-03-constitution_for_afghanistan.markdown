<p>I usually avoid mentioning politics here, but the BBC has some news about the newly-drafted <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/south_asia/3236389.stm" title="BBC NEWS | World | South Asia | Afghanistan unveils constitution">Constitution for Afghanistan</a> that might, just might, turn out to be something good. If any country has suffered enough to merit turning into the first Islamic, democratic state, it clearly is this one.</p>
