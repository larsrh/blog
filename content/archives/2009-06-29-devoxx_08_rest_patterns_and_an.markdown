<p>The good folks at Parleys have <a href="http://tinyurl.com/ksaksc">published a video</a> of my talk at Devoxx '08; watch it and be impressed by their super-slick viewer application. I put up <a href="/blog/st/presentations/2008/2008-12-10-REST-Patterns--Devoxx.pdf">the slides</a> (12 MB PDF) a while ago.</p>

<p>Wow - that&#8217;s definitely neat.  We at the rheinjug and ruhrjug can&#8217;t quite match that - although our publication of a video with a talk from Stefan isn&#8217;t that bad either, I think.</p>

<p>On page 44 of these slides you give &#8220;RESTful Cookie Recipe&#8221;
Why having auth_token is better than having the user send you username and password each time?
to verify the token server still has to keep username and password in cache, what is the gain?</p>
