<p>This had me grinning ear to ear, like a good movie -- Kurt Denke, CEO of <a href="http://www.bluejeanscable.com/">Blue Jeans Cable</a>, <a href="http://www.audioholics.com/news/industry-news/blue-jeans-strikes-back">reacts to being attacked by Monster's lawyers</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I do not compromise with bullies and I would rather spend fifty thousand dollars on defense than give you a dollar of unmerited settlement funds.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Make sure you read the whole letter, if only to admire the style of writing.</p>
