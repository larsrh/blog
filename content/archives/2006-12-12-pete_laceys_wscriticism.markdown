<blockquote><p>In this interview, Pete Lacey, who recently became well-known in the SOA community because of a series of blog posts starting with a very funny one entitled <a href="http://wanderingbarque.com/nonintersecting/2006/11/15/the-s-stands-for-simple/">S stands for Simple</a> (which was <a href="http://www.infoq.com/news/2006/11/s-stands-for-simple">covered at InfoQ</a> as well), talks to InfoQ&#8217;s Stefan Tilkov about the problems he sees with Web services, including basic technologies such as SOAP, WSDL and UDDI, as well as advanced standards from the WS-* family.</p></blockquote>

<p>The great thing about <a href="http://wanderingbarque.com/nonintersecting/">Pete</a>, who I know back from his Systinet days, is that I only had to serve the right questions and he just perfectly expressed my opinion, much better than I could have done :-) <a href="http://www.infoq.com/articles/pete-lacey-ws-criticism">Read the full interview here</a>.</p>

<p>Don&#8217;t exactly see any ringing endorsement of Pete&#8217;s views.  Rather I see a lot of holes being poked (even in my private communication with other like-minded people).  At least its not the echo chamber this time!</p>

<p>Dilip, if everyone agreed, this would be very boring :-) I never assumed there&#8217;d be widespread agreement; I just personally happen to share many (if not all) of Pete&#8217;s views.</p>
