	  <p>I thought my gadget-mania had been cured, but this announcement makes me wonder whether it&#8217;s maybe only dormant:</p>

<blockquote>This week, [Nokia] chief executive Jorma Ollila unveils a prototype of the Communicator 9500, a device that ties more neatly and swiftly into corporate IT systems than any gadget Nokia has offered to date. Among the 9500&#8217;s selling points is wi-fi circuitry that allows users to connect to the Internet in wireless hot spots and securely link up with business networks. </blockquote>

<p>That does not sound bad at all &#8230;
