<p>James Wonders whether the &#8220;inventors&#8221; feel no shame at all. Predictably, people will point out to him how those poor guys probably had no choice but to agree to this. To which I say: Bullshit.</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t think Mark agreed. He hated it, tried to resist it, was pressed into doing it, and ultimately quit. He even wrote about it.</p>

<p>Which earns him about as much respect as any one person is ever going to get from me (in matters this worldly, that is).</p>

<p>Well – Mark was indeed a poor guy and did indeed have no choice. That’s no bullshit. (You will also find that Mark quit for other reasons, not because he had to file the patent; although I imagine that incident provided additional motivation.)</p>

<p>And it’s not inconceivable that these guys really did had no choice in the matter. It’s <em>probably</em> bullshit, however, that they are <em>poor</em> guys: I doubt that they tried to resist the way Mark did. That’s not what I’m disputing. They should certainly be ashamed, whether or not they had any choice – as Mark is.</p>

<p>I’m arguing a fine point, I know. We agree about much more than we disagree about. But as my ancient namesake said:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>To be mad at someone – that is easy. To be mad at the right person, for the right reason, at the right time and at the right degree – that is not easy.</p>
