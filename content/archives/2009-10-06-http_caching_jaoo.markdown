<p>Hi Stefan,
Excellent - I loved the Don Box quote near the end. Perfect justification for my research. Just the last line from the Don Box quote &#8220;GET is the classic &#8216;first bag is free&#8217; kind of feature a platform builder dreams about&#8221;. What does this mean exactly?</p>

Sean.</p>
