<p>From a <a href="http://www.zapthink.com/report.html?id=ZAPFLASH-03172004">ZapThink report</a>:</p>

<blockquote>Here&#8217;s the hard truth: there are no permanent Web Services or SOA &#8220;markets.&#8221; Web Services are interfaces to software, not software itself. SOA is architecture, which means the organization of software and other resources, not those resources themselves. The markets for Web Services and SOA products and services we do have are transitional &#8212; that is, arbitrary categories brought to life to add definition to markets in transformation. Once companies figure out
what Web Services and SOAs are really for, such temporary markets will evaporate as quickly as the online underwear pure-play. </blockquote>

<p>An interesting read, even if you don&#8217;t happen to agree.</p>
