<p>Excellent observations from <a href="http://thedailywtf.com/Articles/Programming-Sucks!-Or-At-Least,-It-Ought-To-.aspx">Alex Papadimoulis</a>, editor of The Daily WTF:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Programming is not fun. It’s boring, it’s tedious, and it’s certainly not challenging. And no matter how much you stretch it, programming is most definitely not sexy.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Read the whole thing, it&#8217;s absolutely worth it.</p>
