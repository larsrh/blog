	  <p>What are the most common criticisms/doubts people have about using RESTful HTTP?</p>

<p>Here is an initial list I&#8217;ve come up with (please note that I&#8217;m <em>not</em> conceding any of them are justified ;-) :</p>

<ul>
<li>REST may be usable for CRUD, but not for &#8220;real&#8221; business logic</li>
<li>Who would actually <em>want</em> to expose so much of their application?</li>
<li>Resources are too low-level, i.e. an implementation detail one should not expose</li>
<li>There is no formal contract/no description language</li>
<li>REST works with HTTP only, it&#8217;s not transport protocol independent (I shuddered when I wrote this)  </li>
<li>No transactions</li>
<li>No reliability</li>
<li>No (message-based) security</li>
<li>No vendor/tool support</li>
<li>No asynchronous interactions</li>
<li>No pub/sub support</li>
</ul>

<p>Did I miss any?</p>

<p>Maybe not specifically REST, but implied:</p>

<p>Thanks Tim :-) I think it&#8217;s been a long time since someone actually advocated pure object-oriented concepts for remote-orientation &#8230; Michi Henning excepted, of course. OTOH, Mark Baker has been fond of arguing that he kept his &#8220;distobj&#8221; email address because HTTP has more OO heritage than Web services &#8230;</p>

<ul>
<li>bi-directional inter-actions</li>
<li>hence no orchestration/choreography capability</li>
<li>lack of assembly model for resource inter-actions</li>
<li>no policies</li>
<li>events (real ones)</li>

<p>Thanks JJ. I wouldn&#8217;t exactly call these common &#8212; with the exception of the policy and event aspects, I consider them rather &#8220;JJ-specific&#8221;. Do you see a difference between the &#8220;events&#8221; and the &#8220;pub/sub&#8221; doubt?</p>

<p>REST&#8217;s biggest problem, <b><i>BY FAR</i></b>, is that there is no practical, clear &amp; consistent guidance on how to design it.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve got to agree with JJ on the versioning issue. Came up two times in a row, while I was giving talks on Service Design and RESTful Web Services.</p>

<p>I would also like to add &#8220;No Support for Concurreny&#8221; (he, he, one of my favorites!)</p>

<p>You left off all the business level objections:</p>

<ul>
<li>No tooling support.</li>
<li>Does not fit in with my chosen vendor&#8217;s go forward strategy.</li>
<li>Does not align IT with business</li>
<li>Does not play nice with my BPM solution</li>
<li>Does not play nice with my ESB</li>
<li>Does not have management buy in</li>

<p>&#8220;I couldn’t disagree more&#8221;</p>

<p>Then can you point to any practical, clear &amp; consistent design guidance?</p>

<p>Why does every supposedly RESTful API set vary so much, if there even is general agreement that they are RESTful in the first place?</p>

<p>But I plan to write more about these doubts in an article &#8212; I&#8217;ll let all of you know once it&#8217;s online. </p>

<p>Thanks for the reminder :-) Let me take on those that I consider unfounded first. This is one of the few that I believe has merit.</p>
