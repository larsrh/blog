<blockquote>
<p>Further, I really don&#8217;t believe in the idea that there will be a next big language. Call me strange, but just because we&#8217;ve had this cycle two or three times doesn&#8217;t mean it will continue like that. I believe development is qualitively different now compared to 15 years ago. The challenges we meet are different and demand different tools. One single language will not cut it. I think the future lies in layered languages with different properties.</p>
