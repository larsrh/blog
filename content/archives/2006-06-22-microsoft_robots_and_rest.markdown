<blockquote>Microsoft has announced <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/robotics/">Robotics Studio</a>; while this may be interesting, it is not of obvious relevance to SOA. But <a href="http://www.mnot.net/blog/2006/06/20/henrik_has_robots">Mark Nottingham</a> has discovered something interesting in the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/robotics/getstarted/prgmmodel/default.aspx">Microsoft Robotics Application Model</a>, which is used to faciliate creation of robotics applications. To quote,
<blockquote> The Microsoft Robotics Studio Runtime provides a service oriented architecture which combines key aspects of traditional Web-based architecture with pieces from Web Services to provide a highly flexible and lightweight, distributed application model.</blockquote> (full story at <a href="http://www.infoq.com/news/Microsoft%2C-REST%2C-and-Robots">InfoQ.com</a>).

<p>I find this totally amazing; too bad it&#8217;s currently restricted to this rather exotic domain.</p>
