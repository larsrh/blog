<p>&#8230; but <a href="http://jroller.com/page/fate/20040408#move_over_frameworks_here_come">Hani</a> writes this:</p>

<blockquote>Reading the &#8216;white paper&#8217; justifying keel&#8217;s existence fills me with regret that I don&#8217;t have a printer that takes in toilet paper. Had I such a wondrous device, this paper would the the leading candidate for printing on said medium, and I&#8217;d rush to ingest as much vindaloo curry as I can to ensure that this printed material gets the usage it so richly deserves.</blockquote>
