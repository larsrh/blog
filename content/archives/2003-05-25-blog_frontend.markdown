<p><a href="http://wbloggar.com/">w.bloggar</a> is a nice blogging front-end. I took a look at it when I had a brief encounter with <a href="http://www.blogger.com">blogger.com</a>. Nice, although and seems to work fine with MT (at least if you see this post ;-). I especially like the preview ... now, if only this had an integrated RSS aggregator, I'd be completely happy ;-)</p>
