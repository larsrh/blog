	  <p>Is <a href="http://www.25hoursaday.com/weblog/PermaLink.aspx?guid=27b4fb9a-37a6-4bbe-8a43-04f965f7a54e">RDF a More Extensible XML</a>? I&#8217;m not convinced at all, watching this discussion evolve promises to be interesting.

<blockquote>
<p>The more I look at how RDF people bag on XML the more it seems that they don&#8217;t really write applications in today&#8217;s world. Almost every situation I&#8217;ve seen someone claim that RDF technologies will in the future be able to&#160;solve a problem XML&#160;cannot, the problem is actually not only solveable with XML technologies but actually is being solved using XML technologies today. &#160;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I can&#8217;t claim to have looked into RDF in much detail, but my feeling is more that every time someone claims RDF can solve a problem that XML can&#8217;t, it can actually be solved by neither.</p>
