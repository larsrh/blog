<p><a href="http://schneider.blogspot.com">Jeff</a> thinks <a href="http://schneider.blogspot.com/archives/2004_04_11_schneider_archive.html#108221098510178428">UDDI is a failure</a>. I have no problem to agree that the UBR &mdash; the centralized, all-encompassing registry where everybody registers their public services &mdash; can be called a failure. But I strongly object to calling UDDI a failure in the typical SOA scenario, which is something happening within the enterprise or in a group of trusted partners. </p>

<p>I agree that UDDI is not perfect. In fact, I had an opinion similar to Jeff&#8217;s for quite some time &mdash; until I actually spent a while familiarizing myself with the conceptual details. I have since come to the conclusion that all this taxonomy and categorization stuff is actually pretty ingenious. LDAP doesn&#8217;t seem to be suited to the purpose at all, and saying &#8220;let&#8217;s just an RDBMS&#8221; is like saying &#8220;let&#8217;s drop this SAP crap, we&#8217;ll just use DB2&#8221;.</p>
