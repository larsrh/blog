<p><a href="http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2006/07/24/Ruby#p-2">Tim Bray</a>: </p>

<blockquote>
<p>For people like me, who are proficient in Perl and Java, Ruby is remarkably, perhaps irresistibly, attractive. Over the last week I&#8217;ve got an unreasonable amount of work done in a ridiculously short period of time, with lots of interruptions, in a language I previously didn&#8217;t know. It&#8217;s intuitive enough that I&#8217;ve often found myself guessing at a syntax or a method or a usage and getting it right first time.</p>
