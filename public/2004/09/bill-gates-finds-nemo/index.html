	  <p>I find <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/print/technology/content/sep2004/tc2004092_2455.htm">this</a> so funny I just have to link to it (emphasis mine):</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Q [to Bill Gates]: Steve Jobs has said consumers aren't going to watch video on tiny screens. Is he wrong?
A: Yes. Ask kids in the back of a car on a two-hour trip, "Hey, would you like to have your videos there?" My kids would. I guess Steve's kids just listen to Bach and Mozart. But mine, they want to watch Finding Nemo. <em>I don't know who made that, but it's really a neat movie.</em> </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yeah, sure he doesn't know <a href="http://www.pixar.com/companyinfo/aboutus/mte.html">who</a> made <a href="http://www.pixar.com/featurefilms/nemo/">that</a> :-)</p>

<p>I think he will advice Bach and Mozart to his children as soon as he reads your posting :-)</p>
