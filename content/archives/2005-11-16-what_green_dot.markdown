<p><a href="http://norman.walsh.name/2005/11/13/badeyes">Norm Walsh points</a> to this <a href="http://www.patmedia.net/marklevinson/cool/cool_illusion.html">great optical illusion</a>. He also makes a common (if I may says so) mistake among bloggers:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>(I&#8217;m never sure how useful &#8220;me too&#8221; posts like this are. What, after all, are the odds that you read these pages but neither James nor Tony? Pretty small, I expect. But if it happens to be so in your case, might I suggest two more bloggers for your list&#8230;)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The assumption that someone who reads &#8220;you&#8221; follows any of the blogs you read yourself is simply wrong.</p>
