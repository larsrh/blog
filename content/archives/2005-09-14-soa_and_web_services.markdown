<p>I did my presentation at the <a href="http://domains.euroforum.com/soa-days/">SOA Days Technology Conference 2005</a> today; its topic was Web services and SOA. I doubt you&#8217;ll get much value from the slides without the accompanying audio track, but <a href="/blog/st/presentations/2005/SOA/SOA-Days-2005-09-14.pdf">here they are</a> anyway, mostly for being able to point people here.</p>

<p>I will point sooo many people to your blog&#8230;
why don&#8217;t you publish your audio-track as a podcast -
I&#8217;m pretty sure that Frank (aka Tonabnehmer) will enjoy to add
one more episode to his podblog&#8230;</p>
