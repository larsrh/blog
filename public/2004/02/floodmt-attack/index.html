	  <p>Somebody started massively flooding my blog with comments, obviously automated pretty efficiently. I&#8217;ve reattached the comments to this entry.
Update: A quick <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=floodmt">Google search</a> shows that the script to do this is freely available, which sucks, but there&#8217;s probably not much one can do about it.
Update: There&#8217;s some discussion about the crap flooders going on; some patches I may apply are available from <a href="http://philringnalda.com/blog/2004/01/throttling_down.php">Phil Ringnalda</a>&#8217;s blog.
Update: I had left the comments for possibly trying to find out more, but it seems this is actually old news (an excellent step-by-step guide to a safer blog is available at <a href="http://weblog.burningbird.net/fires/technology/stepping_stones_to_a_safer_blog.htm">Burningbird</a>). I&#8217;ll remove the comments and leave only one of them, so perhaps somebody looking around as I did today will stumble across the instructions.</p>

<p>FloodMT is the first integrated solution for testing Movable Type blogs for working anti-spamming features. It can also be used to check the effectiveness of plugins such as MT-Blacklist and ClearComments. It has been tested with Movable Type 2.6, and should even work with version 2.66 if a sufficient number of proxies are used.</p>

<p>Written in the procedural programming paradigm, FloodMT is a multithreaded script compatible with Python 2.2 and onwards, using only core libraries. It is the ideal solution for Movable Type crapflooders, scalable across the enterprise and all other applications. A port to Haskell is being considered.
