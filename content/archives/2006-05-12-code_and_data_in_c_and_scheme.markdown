<p>I hate the syntax of the lambda expression too&#8230; why can&#8217;t we use a function-syntax like would be used in C# 2.0?  Something akin to:</p>

<p>with(var e) { return e + 5; }
// or
lambda(var e) { return e + 5; }</p>

<p>would be much clearer than:</p>

<p>e => e + 5</p>

<p>Actually, I object to that part of the syntax included due to its C heritage :-) </p>

<p>(Not entirely serious; I understand why so many languages have adopted the rather strange C conventions, C++, C# and Java included. But mixing in more and more idioms from other languages certainly doesn&#8217;t make it any prettier &#8230;)</p>
