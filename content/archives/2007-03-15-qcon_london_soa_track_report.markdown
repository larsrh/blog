<p>So we&#8217;ve finished <a href="http://qcon.infoq.com/qcon/tracks/show_track.jsp?trackOID=32">the SOA track</a> here at <a href="http://qcon.infoq.com/">QCon</a> &#8212; and at least from my perspective as a track host, it went extremely well. (Never mind that right now Martin Fowler and Dan North are making fun of some of the session titles :-) Miko Matsumura and I did the track intro together, and I think we did a decent job (especially considering we actually met for the first time 15 minutes before our presentation). <a href="http://qcon.infoq.com/qcon/speakers/show_speaker.jsp?oid=117">Anne Thomas Manes</a> gave a very good talk, especially addressing the question of how to &#8220;sell&#8221; SOA to management. <a href="http://qcon.infoq.com/qcon/speakers/show_speaker.jsp?oid=197">Paul Downey</a> was excellent, too &#8212; his very visual presentation made a great case for the Web as a service platform. <a href="http://qcon.infoq.com/qcon/speakers/show_speaker.jsp?oid=144">Steve Jones</a> had a very different focus, dismissing technology and focussing on the business side, another great talk. <a href="http://qcon.infoq.com/qcon/speakers/show_speaker.jsp?oid=158">Paul Fremantle</a> talked about a lot of different things, but also addressed the REST-vs.-WS-* issue, and it&#8217;s very obvious that he knows what he&#8217;s talking about (even though I don&#8217;t happen to agree with him). <a href="http://qcon.infoq.com/qcon/speakers/show_speaker.jsp?oid=160">Jim Webber&#8217;s talk</a> was a great (and very funny) conclusion &#8212; if I&#8217;m not wearing my RESTafarian hat, Jim&#8217;s views are very much in line with my personal beliefs.</p>

<p>All in all, I think all of the speakers have exceeded my already high expectations &#8212; and it&#8217;s been great to meet so many people I&#8217;ve known only virtually before in person. I also managed to interview all of the speakers for <a href="http://www.infoq.com/">InfoQ</a> (except for the one with Paul Downey, which I plan to do tomorrow), and all of the presentations have been videotaped, too &#8212; a lot of excellent content to look forward to.</p>
