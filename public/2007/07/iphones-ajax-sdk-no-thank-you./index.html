<blockquote>
<p>What I&#8217;m not willing to do is starting programming in AJAX, as Steve so gleefully announced we should do at the (non-nondisclosured) WWDC keynote this year. What you might not have heard, if you only saw the video online, were the moans of the developers in the room when he announced this &#8220;no-SDK&#8221; SDK&#8230; if this AJAX thing was just a trial balloon, as some have theorized, then Steve should have had Jimmy Page up there, because it flew like a lead zeppelin.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="/blog/st/2007/06/12/iphone_sdk.html">My initial reaction</a> (from reading the news about the non-SDK) was positive, but based on the (wrong) assumption that there&#8217;s be hooks to access the phone&#8217;s capabilities. I still believe that if this were the case, using the browser as the platform would be a great move (for Apple, not necessarily for loyal Apple developers &#8212; but Apple does not strike me as a company that would care very much).</p>
