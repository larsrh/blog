<p>In an <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/4/35481.html">opinion piece</a> on the register, the author questions the usefulness of a .NET/C# implementation on non-MS platforms. Slashdot has the <a href="http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=04/02/13/1416226">predictable thread</a>.
I totally agree &mdash; I have never seen the point, too. In fact, I already had my first couple of heated discussions about this. I have nothing against C# or .NET (or Qt or Motif or Cocoa or Carbon or whatever), but I fail to see the point of trying to extend an OS-/platform-dependent environment to another platform. If I want to do platform independent development, I&#8217;ll use a platform-neutral environment like Java, or some scripting language like Python or Ruby.</p>
