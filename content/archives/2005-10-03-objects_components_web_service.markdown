<p>I harbor an intense dislike for Roger Sessions, but I like <a href="http://www.acmqueue.com/modules.php?name=Content&amp;pa=printer_friendly&amp;pid=246&amp;page=1">this definition</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Objects share a common operating system process, components share a common hosting/runtime environment, and services share nothing but a common message format. [&#8230;] Web services are useful for tying together autonomous systems; components for coordinating the process distribution within a system; objects for organizing the code within a process.</p>
