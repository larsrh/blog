<p><a href="http://www.lhotka.net/">Rockford Lhotka</a> criticizes the contract metaphor in a <a href="http://www.theserverside.net/articles/showarticle.tss?id=SOAVersioningCovenant">TSS.NET article</a>. I don&#8217;t necessarily agree with all facets of the proposed solution approach; but with his problem analysis, I believe he&#8217;s absolutely right &#8212; WSDL-centrism, static typing, RPC, tight coupling; all linked, all bad in the face of loosely-coupled real-world connections.</p>
