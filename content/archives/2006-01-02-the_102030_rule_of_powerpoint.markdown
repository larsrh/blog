<p>From <a href="http://blog.guykawasaki.com/2005/12/the_102030_rule.html">The 10/20/30 Rule of PowerPoint</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It&#8217;s quite simple: a PowerPoint presentation should have ten slides, last no more than twenty minutes, and contain no font smaller than thirty points. [&#8230;] Sure, you have an hour time slot, but you&#8217;re using a Windows laptop, so it will take forty minutes to make it work with the projector. [&#8230;] If &#8220;thirty points,&#8221; is too dogmatic, the I offer you an algorithm: find out the age of the oldest person in your audience and divide it by two. That&#8217;s you&#8217;re optimal font size. </p>

<p>Smart stuff.</p>
