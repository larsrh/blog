<blockquote>
<p>The Google data APIs (&#8220;GData&#8221; for short) provide a simple standard protocol for reading and writing data on the web. GData combines common XML-based syndication formats (Atom and RSS) with a feed-publishing system based on the Atom publishing protocol, plus some extensions for handling queries.</p>
