<p><a href="http://www.bejug.org/confluenceBeJUG/display/~stephan">Stephan Janssen</a> just let me know that <a href="http://www.parleys.com/display/PARLEYS/The+State+of+REST+vs.+SOA?showComments=true">the video of my talk at the BeJUG SOA conference</a> is online. It ends a little abruptly (maybe my plugs for <a href="http://www.infoq.com/">InfoQ</a> and <a href="http://qcon.infoq.com:80/sanfrancisco/conference/">QCon SF</a> were a little too shameless &#8230;) and doesn&#8217;t include the very interesting (I believe) Q&#38;A afterwards.</p>
