<p>Expect some weirdness around here while I play around with a MovableType update. </p>

<p><em>Update: Most of the stuff should be working again now.</em></p>

<p>A test comment &#8230; look, MT4 does CAPTCHAs, too.</p>

<p>Some entries show up in Google Reader as raw text, without paragraphs. Ans they are all unread, but that was to be expected ;-)</p>

<p>Complaints:</p>

<ol>
<li>All your feed entries got new IDs, so I got a pile of dupes in my reader. Worse, all the entry dates changed as well.</li>
<li>In the feed, the entry fulltext is raw Markdown – it doesn’t get rendered to HTML.</li>
</ol>

<p>Positives:</p>

<p>I like the response time! Before the update your old blog always took several seconds to load a page. Now it takes no time to speak of.</p>

<p>Thanks for the feedback!</p>

<p>Not much I can do about the entry IDs, I guess - this should be a one-time annoyance only. Content in the feed should now be HTML again.</p>
