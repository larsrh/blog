<p><a href="http://www.ebpml.org/">JJ</a> links to a <a href="http://www.idealliance.org/papers/dx_xmle04/slides/prescod.ppt">presentation</a> from <a href="http://www.prescod.net/">Paul Prescod</a> about resource-oriented as opposed to service-oriented architectures. I find the argument convincing that the difference between SOA and ROA (REST) is more about whether there are services at all than about what kind of interface (uniform or not) is exposed.</p>
