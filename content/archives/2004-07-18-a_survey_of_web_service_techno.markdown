<p>Mike Papazoglou and <a href="http://www.ebpml.org/publications.htm">Jean-Jacques Dubray</a>  have published <a href="http://eprints.biblio.unitn.it/archive/00000586/">A survey of Web Service Technologies</a>. Too much for the late hour for me, but knowing other stuff from JJ, very likely worth checking out.</p>
