<blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.alphaworks.ibm.com/tech/wssem/">Semantic Tools for Web Services</a> is a set of Eclipse plug-ins that allow developers to insert into a WSDL document semantic annotations (references to concepts in a semantic model) that describe the semantics of the input, output, preconditions, and effects of service operations.</p>

<p>Extremely interesting, especially in light of some recent discussions we had with a couple of partners (found via <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/cweyer/archive/2005/06/15/413155.aspx">Christian Weyer</a>)</p>
