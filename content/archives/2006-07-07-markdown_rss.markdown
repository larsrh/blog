<p>Very cool: Using <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown">Markdown</a> to <a href="http://www.martinkahr.com/2006/07/06/everything-markdown-even-rss/">generate RSS feeds</a>. I&#8217;m a big Markdown fan, too, and have used it e.g. to create slides (using some simple pre- and postprocessing). I used some weird Perl/sh combination; as there&#8217;s a Markdown implementation for Ruby, <a href="http://www.deveiate.org/projects/BlueCloth">BlueCloth</a>, Ruby is probably a much better fit.</p>
