<blockquote>
<p><a href="http://carbonado.sourceforge.net/index.html">Carbonado</a> is an extensible, high performance persistence abstraction layer for Java applications, providing a relational view to the underlying persistence technology. Persistence can be provided by a JDBC accessible SQL relational database, or it can be a BDB. It can also be fully replicated between the two.</p>

<p>The interesting thing about this thing is that it&#8217;s been built by Amazon.com [via <a href="http://www.allthingsdistributed.com/2006/10/carbonado.html">Werner Vogels</a>].</p>
