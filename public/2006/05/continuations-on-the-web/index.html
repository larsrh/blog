<p>Continuations are most useful as a building block for other useful things. Backtracking — e.g. in logic programming, Processes — e.g. in concurrent programming, Co-routines — e.g. in web interactions, Exception handling, etc. All of these can be implemented in “one-off” specialized ways. But if you have continuations then the implementations of each of these becomes nearly trivial.</p>

<p>If you like these, then you like continuations.</p>

<p>I guess my applications are usually too boring &#8212; while e.g. RoR&#8217;s use of Ruby&#8217;s DSL features is something that has a direct application to problems I deal with, I&#8217;m rarely involved with logic programming. Obviously exception handling or co-routines are something else, though - I&#8217;ll have to do some research to appreciate this (any pointers appreciated).</p>
