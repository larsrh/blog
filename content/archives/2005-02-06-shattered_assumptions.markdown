<p>What a great quote from <a href="http://www.25hoursaday.com/weblog/PermaLink.aspx?guid=d43485f8-0df0-4e71-a5c1-25aca5a787d7">Dare Obasanjo</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>One of the&#160;biggest&#160;assumptions I had about software development was shattered  when I started working on the XML team at Microsoft. This assumption was that standards  bodies know what they are doing and produce specifications that are indisputable.</p>
