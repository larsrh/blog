<p>I&#8217;m late to link to two very interesting posts by <a href="http://www.mnot.net/blog/">Mark Nottingham</a>: One about <a href="http://www.mnot.net/blog/2004/04/19/async">different ways to achieve asynchrony</a>, the other one about <a href="http://www.mnot.net/blog/2004/04/14/rest_in_wsdl">describing RESTful Web resources</a> using WSDL.</p>
