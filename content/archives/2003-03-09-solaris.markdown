<p>I just returned from watching the movie <a href="http://www.solaristhemovie.com/" title="[ 20th Century Fox -- Solaris ]">Solaris</a> by Steven Soderberg. Without any doubt it's an excellent work of art, although I'm not so sure I really understood the story ... Is this because I'm not supposed to? Or because I have not read Lem's book?<br />
I have the feeling that the last 20 seconds of the story have been added to make the movie more to the liking of US viewers - without them, it would have felt a lot better. I will have to read the novel after all ...</p>
