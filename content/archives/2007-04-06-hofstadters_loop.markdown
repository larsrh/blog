<p><a href="http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2007/04/04/Hofstadter">Tim Bray</a> writes about Douglas Hofstadter&#8217;s new book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Am-Strange-Loop-Douglas-Hofstadter/dp/0465030785/">I Am A Strange Loop</a>. I can&#8217;t comment on the review itself, since I&#8217;ve just ordered and not yet read the book, but Tim also writes:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Having said all that, I&#8217;m pretty sure that Hofstadter&#8217;s finest work, and the one most likely to have intellectual currency a few centuries from now, is <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Ton-Beau-Marot-Praise-Language/dp/0465086454">Le Ton beau de Marot</a>, which is at once stimulating, entertaining, erudite, beautiful, and tragic.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I couldn&#8217;t agree more &#8212; <em>Le Ton Beau de Marot</em> is, by far, the best (non-fiction) book I&#8217;ve ever read.</p>
