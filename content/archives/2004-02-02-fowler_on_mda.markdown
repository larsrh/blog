<p><a href="http://martinfowler.com/bliki/ModelDrivenArchitecture.html">Martin Fowler thinks MDA is a bad idea</a>. Obviously, I strongly <a href="/blog/st/archives/000177.html">disagree</a>, and find it amusing that - from all sources available - he choses to link to a paper I&#8217;ve <a href="/blog/st/archives/000528.html">criticized before</a>. Given that I received a comment similar in spirit to Martin&#8217;s from <a href="http://www.innoq.org/movabletype/mt-comments.cgi?__mode=red&#38;id=309">Scott Ambler</a>, I believe I need to address this in a new posting &#8230; expect something by tomorrow :-)</p>
