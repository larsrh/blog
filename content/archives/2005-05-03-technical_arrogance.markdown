<p>Another excellent <a href="http://www.itworld.com/Tech/2987/nls_ebizmediators050429/index.html">article</a> by <a href="http://seanmcgrath.blogspot.com/">Sean McGrath</a>: I agree that in many cases, technological problems have their root in social aspects. A typical example is solutions that expect to be the single point of truth, the master in control of everybody else; true of many EAI, BPM and workflow management solutions. In the end, whether you&#8217;re a real person or an application, you get along a lot better if you try to enforce your views using diplomacy, negotiations, and compromises instead of expecting everyone to play by your rules.</p>
