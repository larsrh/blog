<p>In my mind I was screaming &#8220;No! No! No!&#8221; because I&#8217;ve generally felt that the pain and complexity involved in object-relational and object-XML and object-messaging mapping outweigh the benefits; that if your application is based on exchanging messages, then the message exchange has to be visible to the application programmer. I&#8217;m not alone in having this kind of reflex.<br />
Well, it seems that both Ruby on Rails and Seaside would tend to disagree, and the evidence is building up on their side.<br />
And today I had a date with a Vancouver startup that I&#8217;ll write up when they&#8217;re ready; they have a very damn sophisticated Web app that I wish I&#8217;d been smart enough to think of, solid useful function and a ton of graceful little flourishes; and it&#8217;s all Seaside, all continuations, all simple methods that conduct orderly dialogues with the user.<br />
Maybe I&#8217;m wrong. Maybe you can abstract the Web away. Hmph.</p>

<p>I would be very interested in seeing continuations in a real application; every example I have seen so far was rather trivial. I imagine that there&#8217;d be rather complex scalability issues &#8212; after all, all of the state has to be maintained somehow &#8230; I don&#8217;t know how large the overhead created by continuations is, though.</p>
