<p>Great news from W3C: The <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2005/REC-soap12-mtom-20050125/">MTOM</a>, <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2005/REC-xop10-20050125/">XOP</a>, and <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2005/REC-soap12-rep-20050125/">RRSHB</a> specs <a href="http://www.w3.org/2005/01/xmlp-pressrelease">become W3C Recommendations</a> (as much of a standard as you can expect from the folks over there). I&#8217;m looking forward to implementations of MTOM/XOP to finally put an end to binary attachment interop problems.</p>
