<blockquote>
<p>I should make clear here that I am not saying that middleware will become obsolete, because it won&#8217;t. The point I am making is that middleware as we now know it will not be used as a central intermediary between systems anymore (as an ESB or message broker), but instead it will move down in the hourglass model, and will become an enabling technology instead of the central point for integration.</p>

<p>I couldn&#8217;t agree more with <a href="http://loekb.blogspot.com/2006/10/hourglass-model-times-up-for-esb.html">Loek&#8217;s opinion</a>.</p>
