<p><a href="http://wilshipley.com/blog/2007/05/pimp-my-code-part-14-be-inflexible.html">Wil Shipley</a> on YAGNI (without calling it by that name), with agreement from <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/raganwald/~3/120903726/wil-shipley-on-writing-not-so-big.html">Reg Braithwaite</a>. While Wil is talking about a <a href="http://www.delicious-monster.com/">desktop application</a>, I believe the same arguments apply on different scale (e.g. systems, applications, services) as well.</p>
