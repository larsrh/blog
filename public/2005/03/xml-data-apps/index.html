	  <p><a href="http://www.mnot.net/blog/2005/03/02/decision_tree">Mark Nottingham</a> on using XML in data-oriented apps. I&#8217;m puzzled by his scenario 1:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If you&#8217;re thinking in terms of Infosets, XQuery Data Models and the like, your data model is based on XML. This is the approach extolled by most Web services proponents, often through the use of XML Schema-aware tools that bind XML to objects.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I feel that this is a paradox &#8212; I would divide that into 1a) the folks who think in the term of XML as a serialization format and 1b) those who want to work with XML documents because they see them as the core benefit of a Web services-based solution.</p>

<p>I think your 1a is my 1, and your 1b is my 2a. Is there something I&#8217;m missing?</p>

<p>Cheers,</p>

<p>Oops, sorry - switch those two.</p>

<p>Your 1 describes folks that mis-use XML as a record-data serialization format. Your 2 describes folks who use UML or RDF. </p>

<p>Where are those who think in terms of documents and describe them with Relax NG? They don&#8217;t seem to fit in your 1 or 2. Yet those folks do think in terms of XML - where would you put them?</p>

<p><em>confused</em></p>

<p>I talked about the problems of using XML as a serialisation format in 2a; 1 is about modelling your data in XML. RelaxNG would fit into 1.</p>

<p>Why then do you talk about &#8220;often through the use of XML Schema-aware tools that bind XML to objects&#8221; in scenario 1? That sounds to me like something belonging firmly in the 2 camp :-)</p>
