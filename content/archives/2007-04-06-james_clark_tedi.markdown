<p>James Clark has <a href="http://blog.jclark.com/">a blog</a>! His first post introduces TEDI, <a href="http://blog.jclark.com/2007/04/do-we-need-new-kind-of-schema-language.html">a new kind of schema language</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I&#8217;m going to use subsequent posts to try to develop the design of TEDI to the point where it could be implemented; at the moment it&#8217;s not developed enough to know whether it really holds water. If you find the idea interesting, please help with the design process by using comments to give feedback. I promise to try to keep future posts shorter, but I wanted my first real post to have a bit of meat to it.</p>
