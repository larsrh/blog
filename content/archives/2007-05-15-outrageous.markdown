<blockquote>
<p>My name is on a software patent. It happened during my brief tenure at IBM. The patent is not yet issued (as I understand it, issuance may take years) and does not show up in USPTO or Google Patent Search. But it will, someday. [&#8230;] Issuance takes anywhere from 2 to 7 years. By then, IBM will have filed tens of thousands more. It&#8217;s an institutionalized form of madness, outrageous, all-consuming, and incurable. I&#8217;m ashamed to have been a part of it.</p>
