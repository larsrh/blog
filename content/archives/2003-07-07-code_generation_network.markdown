<p>The <a href="http://www.codegeneration.net/" title="Code Generation Network">Code Generation Network</a> is an excellent site with lots of information about code generation, a list of tools (sadly omitting <a href="/iqgen">iQgen</a> as of yet), a very nice <a href="http://www.codegeneration.net/tiki-index.php?page=FrequentlyAskedQuestions">FAQ</a>, and a useful <a href="http://www.codegeneration.net/tiki-index.php?page=ModelsIntroduction">classification</a> of different code generation approaches.<br />
One thing definitely missing (or was I just too dumb to find it?): an RSS feed.</p>

<p>You aren&#8217;t stupid. We don&#8217;t have any RSS feeds, yet. At the moment the best thing to do is to sign up for the newsletter that comes out every week or so.</p>

<p>BTW, we added a page just for MDA.</p>
