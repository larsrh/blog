<p><a href="http://www.tagtraum.com">Hendrik Schreiber</a> (who, BTW, definitely should have a weblog) sent me an excellent article by Martin Fowler, <a href="http://www.martinfowler.com/ieeeSoftware/whoNeedsArchitect.pdf">Who needs an architect</a>. Not exactly new anymore, but very worth reading. Unsurprisingly, I have my own thoughts on <a href="/blog/st/archives/000177.html">making software architecture changeable</a>.</p>
