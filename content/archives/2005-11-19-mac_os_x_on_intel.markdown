<p>From a <a href="http://www.io.com/~bolsinga/archives/2005.html#e171">posting</a> by a former Apple employee:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A few years later I was extra-disclosed and had to sign a NDA (Non-Disclosure Agreement) on the Intel builds. This is when I learned that the Intel builds didn&#8217;t just compile and link. They actually ran, and they ran fast! I hadn&#8217;t seen java run so fast on Mac OS X before, on any hardware. Because using Mac OS X on Intel was such a joy, there was a time that I tried to do all of my work on Intel. I succeeded for a bit, but it was hard. Whenever you used the Mac OS X on Intel machine, you had to close your door and your blinds since not everyone was disclosed. It wasn&#8217;t always so easy to be shut off from the rest of the team that way.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m <em>so</em> looking forward to ordering the first Intel-based PowerBook the day it&#8217;s announced &#8230;</p>
