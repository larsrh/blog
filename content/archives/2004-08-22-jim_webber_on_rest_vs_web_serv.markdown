<p>Still working through my blog post backlog, I found <a href="http://jim.webber.name/">Jim Webber</a>'s <a href="http://webservices.org/index.php/ws/content/view/full/39565">article</a> on webservices.org pretty good. A minor thing: he points out some 'disadvantages' of REST:</p>

<ul>
<li>REST-amenable transports only</li>
<li>Semantics coupled to payload and transfer mode</li>
</ul>

<p>I would argue that these are not disadvantages, but merely differences; but I can see that one's mileage may vary.</p>
