<p>An article very much worth reading by VR guru <a href="http://discovermagazine.com/2007/dec/long-live-closed-source-software/">Jaron Lanier</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The open-source software community is simply too turbulent to focus its tests and maintain its criteria over an extended duration, and that is a prerequisite to evolving highly original things. There is only one iPhone, but there are hundreds of Linux releases. A closed-software team is a human construction that can tie down enough variables so that software becomes just a little more like a hardware chip—and note that chips, the most encapsulated objects made by humans, get better and better following an exponential pattern of improvement known as Moore’s law.</p>
