<blockquote>
<p>I have this sneaking suspicion that some complex problems are complex because there are intrinsically difficult issues, but that some complex problems are complex because of arbitrary and self-created matters, brought about by the technology, the process, bogus requirements. I&#8217;m not disputing at all there are classes of systems that are as Mike says they are, just wondering if perhaps they are edge cases, and how and why WS-* helps there, in a way where you could point to a solution and say WS-* was critical to success.</p>
