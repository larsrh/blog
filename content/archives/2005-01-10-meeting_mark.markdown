<p>Since he is staying in D&#252;sseldorf for a W3C meeting, <a href="http://www.markbaker.ca">Mark Baker</a> got in touch and we scheduled our own face-to-face meeting (a dinner with Deer Ragout, Pork Knuckle and German beer in one of the Old Towns breweries). I really enjoyed it &#8212; it&#8217;s very cool to finally meet someone in person you have interacted with only virtually before. We actually managed to keep tech-talk to a minimum, but needless to say, I have some REST-related re-thinking of my own ideas to do now :-)</p>
