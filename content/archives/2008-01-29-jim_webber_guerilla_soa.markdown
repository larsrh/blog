<blockquote>
<p>In one of the most entertaining presentations on the topic ever, <a href="http://jim.webber.name/">Dr. Jim Webber</a>, SOA practice lead at ThoughtWorks, used his presentation at <a href="http://qcon.infoq.com/london-2007/conference/">the QCon conference</a> to debunk myths about the mainstream ESB concept. Jim argues that there&#8217;s an alternative to the typical, heavyweight and expensive approach to introducting SOA and and explains how a lightweight approach can yield real benefits without giving in to vendor pressure. In Jim&#8217;s opinion, the industry&#8217;s belief in the ESB as the core concept, at least in the way it&#8217;s usually used, is fundamentally mistaken. Jim claims that an ESB often ends up being just a thin veneer on an existing mess, and how an approach that doesn&#8217;t put intelligence into the network is superior.<br /> Don&#8217;t miss <a href="http://www.infoq.com/presentations/webber-guerilla-soa">the full presentation</a> (53&#8221;), which is not only very interesting from a technical standpoint, but also quite hilarious. (Jim Webber will again be presenting at <a href="http://qcon.infoq.com/london/conference/">QCon London 2008</a>, which takes place in March.)</p>

<p>If there&#8217;s one presentation video on SOA I suggest you should really watch in full length, it&#8217;s this one. One of the most entertaining talks I&#8217;ve ever attended.</p>
