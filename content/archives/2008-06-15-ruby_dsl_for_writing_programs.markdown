<blockquote>
<p>S-expressions give Lisp powerful ways to build code in code. But writing programs using S-expressions seems cumbersome compared to Ruby's syntax. The syntax of Ruby shortens the code you have to write to do everyday tasks. It's like a domain specific language for, er, writing computer programs.</p>
