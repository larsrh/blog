	  <p>The <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2005/CR-ws-cdl-10-20051109/" title="Web Services Choreography Description Language Version 1.0">Web Services Choreography Description Language Version 1.0</a> has achieved Candidate Recommendation status. </p>

<p>In case you&#8217;re wondering about the relationship to <a href="http://www.oasis-open.org/committees/download.php/14616/wsbpel-specification-draft.htm">WS-BPEL</a>, here&#8217;s a nice quote from the WG&#8217;s co-chair, <a href="http://www.pi4tech.com">Pi4 Technology</a>&#8217;s Steve Ross-Talbot:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Any real business transaction isn&#8217;t just one function call, it&#8217;s a sequence of function calls and it may be lots of things in parallel between different services that occur. BPEL is about &#8216;how do I construct Web services out of existing Web services.&#8217; In other words, BPEL is about the orchestration of existing services to yield another service.</p>

<p>Choreography is completely complementary to that. WS-CDL is an unambiguous way of describing the relationships between the services in a peer-to-peer collaboration without necessitating any orchestration at all. That&#8217;s very important because if my business and your business are talking together, I can guarantee you that neither of us would accept orchestrating the other&#8217;s services.
[&#8230;]
In any dance, however, you never see somebody on stage telling the dancers what to do. The dancers have a choreography description. I know this because my daughter&#8217;s a dancer. They learn their dance and they learn the &#8216;touch points&#8217; where they interact with others, the same way you do in a choreography description.</p>
