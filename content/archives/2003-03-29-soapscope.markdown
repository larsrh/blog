<p><a href="http://www.gotdotnet.com/team/dbox/" title="Don Box's Spoutlet">Don Box's Spoutlet</a> has the info that SoapScope, which I wanted to take a look at for quite some time (<a href="/blog/st/2003/02/soap-debugger/" title="Random Stuff: SOAP Debugger">Random Stuff: SOAP Debugger</a>), has gotten a Jolt award. I'll have to buy it, after all ... this looks really cool.</p>
