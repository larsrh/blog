<p>Patrick Logan <a href="http://patricklogan.blogspot.com/" title="Making it stick.">has a blog</a>. So what? Apart from some very interesting posts, I somehow recall the name, and have positive assocations with it ... digging ... I found a patricklogan@gemstone.com somewhere. I might know the name from some C++ newsgroup activity in the early 90s.</p>
