	  <p>Sorry for the title, I&#8217;m not really serious. But <a href="http://www.dehora.net/journal/2009/11/14/the-scalability-of-programming-languages/">Bill de hÓra</a> has put up an interesting post regarding Scala:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Yes, I know you can run Django in the JVM via Jython, I know there&#8217;s Clojure, and Groovy too. This is just about the theme of Ned&#8217;s post, which is the type system. And Scala has a better one than Java.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#8217;m still somewhat undecided yet, but I&#8217;m starting to believe that if any language has the chance to become Java&#8217;s successor, it will be Scala. It simply doesn&#8217;t require - or at least it doesn&#8217;t seem to require - the same amount of mind change for typical Java programmers. (You know, it has classes, and curly braces, and it&#8217;s taken seriously by the Java posse.) I&#8217;m not exactly enthusiastic about the language&#8217;s design (XML literals? WTF?), and in fact strongly prefer Clojure as a JVM language. But given the choice between Java and Scala, I won&#8217;t hesitate for a second - Scala is a way, way better language than Java, with its type inference, case classes, and support for functional programming.</p>

<p>So my position on programming languages as of November 2009 is this: For pragmatic reasons, as well as for the fun in programming, there&#8217;s still nothing that beats Ruby or JRuby on Rails for DB-backed Web applications. </p>

<p>From a language design standpoint, I believe that nothing beats Clojure. It&#8217;s my absolute favorite programming language at the moment. So for domains other than mere Web development, I consider Clojure an excellent choice. (I know about <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/compojure?pli=1">Compojure</a>, and it&#8217;s neat, but the community is probably about 0.01% of the size of the Rails community.)</p>

<p>But if the forces that decide things will neither accept Clojure nor Ruby, I&#8217;ll suggest Scala, feeling sure that there&#8217;s simply no reasonable technical argument left to prefer Java instead. Which is somewhat satisfying.</p>

<p>I suspect Groovy wins the mind the gap position. And I know we&#8217;re supposed to like Clojure because it&#8217;s a Lisp, but I&#8217;ll see your XML literals wtf and raise you an STM wtf. A heap is a heap. </p>

<p>&#8220;there’s still nothing that beats Ruby or JRuby on Rails for DB-backed Web applications. &#8220;</p>

<p>Not even Django on Jython?!</p>

<p>&#8220;there’s simply no reasonable technical argument left to prefer Java instead&#8221;</p>

<p>That we can agree on, and I assume the tools will follow. My old boss writes the Scala plugin for Eclipse so I have a lot of faith :)  </p>

<p>Not sure what exactly you mean with your &#8220;a heap is a heap&#8221; comment. Independent from a like or dislike for Lisp, Clojure&#8217;s persistent data structures + STM seems like a great idea to me.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m under the impression that those who favor static languages will not easily be won over by Groovy.</p>

<p>You may have a point on Django, I&#8217;m simply not qualified to comment.</p>

<p>Glad we agree on the last one :-)</p>
