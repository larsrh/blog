<p>Back in May, <a href="/blog/st/archives/000123.html">I was disappointed by C#&#8217;s generics</a>. Now <a href="http://mindview.net/WebLog/log-0050">Bruce Eckel writes about Java Generics</a>, and they have the same problem.
<em>Update:</em> <a href="http://www.25hoursaday.com/weblog/PermaLink.aspx?guid=ec2608d8-3ca6-4dcc-a756-3023859ff94b">Dare Obasanjo</a> goes into more detail. I fail to agree with his claim that C++ doesn&#8217;t really achieve the effect Bruce is looking for, though.</p>
