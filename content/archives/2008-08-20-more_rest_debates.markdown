<p>I'm a little tired of them, but if you have a few hours of your life to waste, here are some more entries in the everlasting REST-vs.-WS-* debate:</p>

<ul>
<li>Tim Bray with <a href="http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2008/08/18/On-REST">some REST questions</a> (or rather, answers)</li>
<li>Damien Katz <a href="http://damienkatz.net/2008/08/rest-i-just-dont-get-it.html">just not getting REST</a></li>
<li>Dino Chiesa is very busy, but manages to write close to a thousand words stating <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/dotnetinterop/archive/2008/08/18/rest-q-a.aspx">it's enough already</a></li>
<li>Leonard Richardson (co-author of RESTful Web Services) <a href="http://www.crummy.com/2008/08/18/0">chimes in, too</a>, <a href="http://www.crummy.com/2008/08/19/0">twice</a> (good stuff)</li>
</ul>

<p>I like Tim's piece, but the most valuable contribution in this round (IMHO, of course) is Dare Obasanjo <a href="http://www.25hoursaday.com/weblog/2008/08/17/ExplainingRESTToDamienKatz.aspx">explaining REST to Damien Katz</a> â€“ this is a very good REST intro.</p>
