<p>Mark Baker <a href="http://www.coactus.com/blog/2006/12/validation-considered-harmful/">considers validation harmful</a>. I agree only half way &#8212; following <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robustness_Principle">Postel&#8217;s law</a> (&#8220;Be conservative in what you do; be liberal in what you accept from others&#8221;), validating what you <em>produce</em> as opposed to what you <em>consume</em> might make sense. Although I&#8217;ve never done it in practice yet, I consider <a href="http://www.schematron.com/">Schematron</a> an ideal candidate for ensuring the necessary preconditions for processing some input are met.</p>
