<p>I find this concept amazingly cool. I recently (almost) got sold on the idea that databases are not worth the hassle and you are just as well off with using files - the same way <a href="http://store.yahoo.com/paulgraham/faq.html">Paul Graham</a> describes what he did with ViaWeb. But this is even better - and for a big majority of systems, it should be the optimal solution. </p>
