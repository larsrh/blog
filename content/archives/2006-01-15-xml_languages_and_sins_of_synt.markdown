<p>Paul R Brown <a href="http://mult.ifario.us/articles/2006/01/15/xml-languages-and-sins-of-syntax" title="XML Languages and Sins of Syntax">writes about</a> the benefits of <em>not</em> using XML &#8212; I totally agree with regards to RELAX NG&#8217;s compact syntax, and I still wonder why no one has come up with a compact syntax for WSDL yet. As WSDL 2.0 supports RELAX NG instead of XML Schema, that might just make it tolerable &#8230;</p>
