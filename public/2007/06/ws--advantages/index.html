<blockquote>
<p>Here&#8217;s my (incomplete) list of scenarios of when you&#8217;d want an alternative to a RESTful protocol&#8230;.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Very good list. Stu also quotes my three suggestions; taken out of context, one might believe that I believe them to be true. I don&#8217;t; here&#8217;s what I wrote <a href="http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/service-orientated-architecture/message/8115">in my original post</a>: </p>

<p>I&#8217;ll make some guesses (note that these don&#8217;t reflect my opinions)</p>

<ol>
<li><p>WS-* is &#8220;protocol independent&#8221;, while REST (in all practical
relevance) is tied to HTTP.</p></li>
<li><p>The WS-* specs address &#8220;enterprise&#8221; concerns that REST/HTTP can&#8217;t
handle</p></li>
<li><p>It&#8217;s much easier to expose an existing system that has a
&#8220;transactional&#8221; interface (in the TP monitor sense) via WS-* than via
REST, since the latter requires a real architectural change and the
former doesn&#8217;t</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Are there any other benefits that WSDL/SOAP/WS-* is claimed to have
over REST/HTTP?</p>

<p>For the record, I believe that (1) is an illusion since the HTTP
protocol is just replaced with a different protocol, one that has no
or at least a much worse design, and the protocol independence is an
extremely leaky abstraction in real applications anyway; regarding
(2), the specs that do address enterprise concerns are not yet widely
adopted anyway and in many cases address something that doesn&#8217;t
belong in the infrastructure layer anyway. I do believe that (3) is a
valid point.</p>

<p>Yeah, as I was re-reading the entry later today I thought I may have not clarified that the 3 points I quoted were out of context, but you beat me to clarifying it ;-)</p>

<p>&#8220;We could reverse this argument: when do the advantages of REST (caching, linking and bookmarking to name some) matter less? For one of my customers I design part of the Dutch national healthcare exchange, which is used to exchange patient data between care providers. Nearly all messages involved include the patient id: therefore most messages are pretty unique&#8230;&#8221;</p>

<p>There is an advantage to using HTTP because there is a lot of software available for it, even though the end result may not use all the features of HTTP.</p>
