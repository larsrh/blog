<p><a href="http://schneider.blogspot.com">Jeff Schneider</a> poses and  <a href="http://schneider.blogspot.com/archives/2004_01_18_schneider_archive.html#107486943664894345">answers</a> an interesting question - does the idea of a service fabric make SOA obsolete? I agree with his view that it does not, although my reasoning would be a bit different: While the fabric (or, if you prefer, ESB or Web services bus) concept might be appropriate for integration scenarios in controlled environments, I think the SOA approach is viable in business-to-business scenarios as well.</p>
