<p>I started to look over the documentation for our next <a href="/iqgen">product</a> release, which is done using DocBook, as <a href="http://www.innoq.org/movabletype/mt-search.cgi?IncludeBlogs=1&amp;search=docbook">reported before</a>. As usual when I start doing stuff like this, I drift into ToolTestMode (a state of something almost, but not entirely, unlike actual work, where one spends hours and hours optimizing the tool set for a task that would have been done ages ago if one had used a piece of paper and a pen to solve it), so I gave <a href="http://www.jclark.com/bio.htm">James Clark</a>&#8217;s <a href="http://www.xmlhack.com/read.php?item=2061">nXML</a> mode a try.</p>

<p>This thing is just <em>great</em>.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/">Tim Bray</a> had a <a href="http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2003/09/18/NXML">comment</a> on this some time ago:</p>

<blockquote>There are 12,587 lines of elisp here apparently implementing a complete XML 1.0 processor and RelaxNG validation engine. Words fail me.</blockquote>
