<blockquote>
<p>Lisp is often promoted as a language preferable over others because it has certain features that are unique, well-integrated, or otherwise useful.<br /><br />What follows is an attempt to highlight a selection of these features of standard Common Lisp, concisely, with appropriate illustrations.<br /><br />This page might be most useful to those with some previous experience in programming, who are marginally interested in Lisp, and want to better understand some of what makes it so attractive.</p>
