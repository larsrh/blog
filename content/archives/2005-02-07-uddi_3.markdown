<p>So <a href="http://www.uddi.org/">UDDI version 3</a> (3.0.2, to be exact) <a href="http://www.oasis-open.org/news/oasis_news_02_03_05.php"> becomes an OASIS standard</a>, only some 2.5 years after <a href="http://www.uddi.org/news/uddi_news_07_30_02.html">this press release</a>! </p>

<p>Impressive.</p>

<p><a href="http://radovanjanecek.net/blog/archives/000179.html">Radovan Janecek comments</a> on <a href="http://www.looselycoupled.com/stories/2005/registry-infr0131.html">this Loosely Coupled article</a> on the subject. While it contains way too much marketing speak for my taste, I liked this statement from Graham Glass:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Glass called for UDDI to widen its scope and embrace some of the emerging standards in the semantice (sic) web such as RDF.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Right &#8212; if only they had done that 3 years ago instead of inventing their own metadata concept.</p>
