<p>I originally took another look at <a href="http://lessig.org/freeculture/free.html">Lawrence Lessig&#8217;s free culture OSCON presentation</a> from 2002 because of the presentation style, reminded by <a href="http://presentationzen.blogs.com/presentationzen/2006/01/the_lessig_meth.html">a link at The Presentation Zen</a> &#8212; but whatever you think of the presentation style (which I personally find just great), this is a powerful talk. The same is true for <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l2nrbmBQXg">this one</a>, concerning Google Book search.</p>
