<p>Can someone please explain the concept of &#8216;irony&#8217; to <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/richardt/archive/2005/12/07/501211.aspx">Rich Turner</a>?</p>

<p>In any case, criticizing the Binary XML effort does not equal considering a binary encoding something bad &#8212; it&#8217;s just not XML.</p>
