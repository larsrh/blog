<p><a href="/blog/hw/2007/08/14/retire_the_tenets.html">Hartmut Wilms</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>WCF might be used in a fully service-oriented way: message-oriented, document-based, contract and policy driven. The common guidance looks different, though. Have a look at ASMX, WCF, Axis 2 and all other SOAP stacks:<br /><br /><em>Just write the classes, we&#8217;ll generate your contract and policy and throw in some XML (De)Serialization for good.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Hartmut is right &#8212; it still amazes me how common the code-first approach still is, to the degree that most developers I meet <em>are not even aware</em> that there&#8217;s an alternative.</p>
