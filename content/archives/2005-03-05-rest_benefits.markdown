<p>Carlos Perez explains why REST is better in code, <a href="http://www.manageability.org/blog/stuff/rest-explained-in-code">Part 1</a>,  <a href="http://www.manageability.org/blog/stuff/why-rest-part-2">part 2</a> (part 3 on asynchronicity to follow). I left some comments to the first post, and the resulting conversation shows only that we can&#8217;t seem to communicate very well &#8230; make no mistake, though: I consider Carlos a very smart guy, and his stuff is very worth reading. Much more than mine, in fact. (Move on, nothing to see here.)</p>

<p>I stubbornly maintain that REST and SOAP are not mutually exclusive, though :-)</p>
