<p>I just watched Dave Thomas&#8217;s <a href="http://rubyconf2008.confreaks.com/keynote.html">presentation on forking Ruby</a> â€“ interesting to see this shortly after <a href="http://www.infoq.com/presentations/hickey-clojure">Rich Hickey&#8217;s excellent Clojure presentation</a>. Funny to see the similarities of Dave&#8217;s &#8220;closure-based Ruby&#8221; proposal and Clojure&#8217;s syntax (which fits on two slides). I have a feeling this Lisp thing might be a good candidate for experimenting with programming language concepts :-)</p>
