	  <p>From <a href="http://developer.amazonwebservices.com/connect/entry.jspa?externalID=634">Amazon&#8217;s Web services developer connection</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>After many years of useful service, the Amazon E-Commerce Service 3.0
(Amazon ECS 3.0) web service will be shut down on March 31, 2008.  Since
the introduction of Amazon ECS 4.0 in late 2004 the usage of Amazon ECS 3.0
has steadily declined as sites and applications have naturally migrated to
Amazon ECS 4.0.  In June of 2006 (Version: 2006-06-28), we achieved
complete feature and data parity between the two services and are now
requesting that all existing sites and applications be migrated to Amazon
ECS 4.0 within the next 12 months.  Beginning March 31, 2008, we will no
longer be accepting Amazon ECS 3.0 requests.  The existing maintenance
effort saved by shutting down Amazon ECS 3.0 will be re-invested into
Amazon ECS 4.0 to allow for the introduction of more features and
capabilities.</p>
