<p>I've uploaded <a href="/blog/st/presentations/2008/2008-09-30-REST-Patterns--JAOO.pdf">the slides from my own talk at JAOO 2008</a>  (warning: this is a 12MB PDF). As usual, not sure how much value they have on their own; YMMV.</p>

<p>Stefan,</p>

<p>as a matter of fact I found some of the advanced topics towards the end of the presentation to be very topical to our current problems. Send (modified) representation of a newly created resource back to the client along 201? Doh! Why didn&#8217;t I think of this sooner&#8230;</p>

<p>As usual - thanks for sharing. Congratulations on a nice talk.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>

<p>I read your presentation/article and it contains good ideas and hints. But one slide with notice &#8220;Stop worrying about URI design&#8221; is contradictory with many other articles. According to me uri design in REST application is crucial. What did you mean this notice?</p>

<p>thanks for reply.</p>

<p>URI design is a useful and reasonably complex discipline. It&#8217;s go nothing to do with REST, though: applications should discover URIs by means of hypermedia, i.e. through following links, and never &#8220;construct&#8221; them. </p>

<p>I don&#8217;t at all object to good URI design, and try to do it myself â€“ I just wanted to point out that people tend to equate this with REST and spend way too much time on it instead of focusing on the more important stuff.</p>
