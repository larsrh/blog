<blockquote>
<p>I am very happy to announce the first release of Ioke!<br /><br />Ioke is a dynamic language targeted at the Java Virtual Machine. Itâ€™s been designed from scratch to be a highly flexible general purpose language. It is a prototype-based programming language that is inspired by Io, Smalltalk, Lisp and Ruby.</p>
