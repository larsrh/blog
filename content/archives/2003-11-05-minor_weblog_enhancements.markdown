<p>I have made two small changes to my MT(MovableType) installation: </p>

<ul>
<li><p>I added &#8220;Brad Choate&#8221;:http://www.bradchoate.com&#8217;s <a href="http://www.bradchoate.com/past/mttextile.php">MT-Textile</a>, which makes writing entries a lot easier</p></li>
<li><p>I included my <a href="http://www.bloglines.com">Bloglines</a>&#8217; subscriptions directly as the blogroll; this is really cool - I can finally manage both in a single place. BTW, if you haven&#8217;t checked it out yet, I can recommend this service without reservations.</p></li>
</ul>
