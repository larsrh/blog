<p><a href="http://bradchoate.com/weblog/2004/11/05/mt-dsbl">MT-DSBL</a>, an MT 3.1 plugin from <a href="http://bradchoate.com">Brad Choate</a>, blocks comments made from blacklisted IP addresses (e.g. through anonymous proxies). While there hasn&#8217;t been any visible comment spam on my blog for a few months (MT-Blacklist catches everything, but unfortunately has some false positives), going through comments and blacklisting is annoying work, and any way to avoid it is welcome.</p>
