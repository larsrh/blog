<p>Since I noticed that I start talking about <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/icad.html" title="Revenge of the Nerds">this</a>  to others, it's got to be referenced here.</p>

<p>Paul Graham talks about LISP, and very convincingly argues his case that developers should spend time learning and using it because there's basically no excuse not to ;-)</p>
