<p>I&#8217;ve been meaning to write about <a href="http://pipes.yahoo.com/">Yahoo! Pipes</a> for a while, but I still haven&#8217;t found the time to take a serious look. Still, experience reports from <a href="http://service-architecture.blogspot.com/2007/02/blog-based-rss-using-yahoo-pipe.html">Steve Jone</a>s and <a href="http://www.snee.com/bobdc.blog/2007/02/checking_out_yahoo_pipes.html">Bob DuCharme</a> make it even more interesting &#8230;</p>
