<p>Very nice interview (just listened this afternoon).  I especially liked the bit about HTTP providing interfaces that we can &#8220;subclass&#8221; &#8212; by abiding HTTP standards around GET/PUT/POST/DELETE we know intermediaries (and/or lowest-common denominator &#8220;discovery&#8221; clients) will work fine.  Our &#8220;subclasses&#8221; of those can still be performing more sophisticated application- or domain-specific tasks.</p>

<p>I find my use of Atom/AtomPub to be quite like that:  everything works quite well on the wider web, but my application specific extensions or categories (i.e., Atom subclasses) have applicability in my space and allow for more sophisticated interactions w/in the app itself.</p>

<p>thanks-
Peter Keane</p>
