<p><a href="http://www.hyperorg.com/backissues/joho-dec29-05.html">David Weinberger</a> on the media&#8217;s problem with <a href="http://www.Wikipedia.org/">Wikipedia</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The media have a cognitive problem with a publisher of knowledge that modestly does not claim perfect reliability, does not back up that claim through a chain of credentialed individuals, and that does not believe the best way to assure the quality of knowledge is by disciplining individuals for their failures. Arrogance, individual heroism, accountability and discipline &#8230; those have been the hallmarks of the institutions that propagate knowledge.</p>
