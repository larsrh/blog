<p>Jeff Walker went to this week&#8217;s Open Group Enterprise Architects Practitioners Conference in San Diego looking to blow a few minds with the notion that service-oriented architecture really can be achieved with a minimum of coding.</p>

<p>Claims about business users who model their requirements and have them turned into code automagically flip the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bozo_bit">bozo bit</a> for me.</p>

<p>I worked on a graphical business process modeling tool for almost three years and can say that it is one of the worst concepts I&#8217;ve been exposed to. The promise was basically that you could fire all your hackers and let &#8220;business analysts&#8221; drag and drop your inventory and sales systems together. It&#8217;s insane. Huge development team spent five years on this thing and when it was done everyone just wanted Perl back. Seeing this all play out was an awesome experience, though :)</p>

<p>Automagic code generation geared towards non-programmers again.. hmm.. fantastic if all you want to do is generate unmaintainable garbage.</p>

<p>if you want to bolster your point with something a bit decent, try a quote by Jerry Weinberg - which says about the same</p>

<p>1973 –1998 (25 years)
Gerald M. Weinberg –The Psychology of Computer Programming, Silver Anniversary Edition </p>

<p>1998: the only thing that has changed here in twenty five years is the fact that the funds dedicated by executives to eliminating programmers from
their payrolls have become far more staggering than I imagined back then. And, now I finally recognize in this executive desire a pattern so strong, so
strong so emotional, that it has blinded these executives in twofacts1. None of these schemes has succeeded in elimination programmers.
We have now at least 10 times as many as we did then.2. Every one of these schemes has been concocted
by the programmers themselves, the very people the executivespassionately want to eliminate.
1973: over the years, executives have backed their desire to eliminate programmers with staggering funds. (p. 4)</p>
