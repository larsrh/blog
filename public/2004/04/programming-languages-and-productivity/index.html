	  <p>Bill de h&#211;ra has written <a href="http://www.dehora.net/journal/archives/000423.html">a very nice essay</a> on programming languages and productivity. While I&#8217;m really getting awfully tired of having MDA put into the camp of clueless let&#8217;s-do-pictures-instead-of-programming advocates, I basically agree that general acceptance of a language with Lisp&#8217;s meta-features would have made MDA obsolete. </p>

<p>If the Lisp community were a little less academic, and actually interested in getting more people to use that excellent language, they would have created a working, well-supported, complete implementation based on the JVM or CLR. That would have taken care of the library problem, and maybe got more people to give it a try.</p>
