<p>Diego writes about <a href="http://www.dynamicobjects.com/d2r/archives/002186.html" title="d2r: the limits of MIDP">the limits of MIDP</a>. What annoys me most (not that I care that much) is that there is no way to access the main phone function - placing a telephone call. I believe an extremely useful application of MIDP could then be an mobile phone-integrating CRM or sales support system.</p>
