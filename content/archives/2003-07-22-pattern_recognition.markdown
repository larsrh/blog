<p><a href="http://fawny.org/pr/" title="‘PR’-otaku: Logging and annotating William Gibson’s ‘Pattern Recognition’ (Joe Clark: fawny.org)">Joe Clark</a> maintains a critique of Gibson's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0399149864/qid=1058880509/sr=8-1/ref=sr_8_1/104-9546273-6327161?v=glance&s=books&n=507846">Pattern Recognition</a> that is so detailed I'm not going to be able to write something comparable ;-)<br />
But it was a nice book. Not great, but good. I like his SF's books better.</p>
