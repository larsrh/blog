<p>From the excellent <a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/002619.html">Language Log</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>So there you have it. China objects to the language name Dzongkha because of an imaginary association with the leader of the legitimate government of its Tibetan colony. In order to please China, Microsoft refuses to use the generally accepted name for the national language of Bhutan. Now there&#8217;s a company with principles.</p>

<p>That may be true. The whole affair still leaves a sour taste in my mouth; I cannot imagine the PRC would base their decision on this fact, so this seems like superpleasing to me. What&#8217;s next, banishing any mention of &#8220;Taiwan&#8221;?</p>
