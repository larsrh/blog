<p><a href="http://www.pacificspirit.com/blog/2007/01/11/soa_principles">Dave Orchard</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This document provides a technical description of SOA and what it means for Architects and developers. Readers should have some familiarity with current technologies such as Web, XML, and Web services. This document provides a view of SOA as a broad set of architecture, design principles and choices used in building distributed systems. In essence, this document views SOA as a few core principles and a set design options or &#8220;knobs&#8221; that are set differently for each particular application depending upon the features required.</p>

<p>No time now, but this definitely merits a very close look.</p>
