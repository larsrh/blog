<p>At <a href="/">innoQ</a>, we routinely provide interested students the opportunity to co-operate on their Master or Diploma Thesis. One very smart student currently working on his master thesis is Dominik Marks, who blogs about his progress <a href="/blog/dm/">on this site</a>. His topic is loose coupling in Web services.</p>

<p>Being able to follow his progress through a blog &#8212; which was something we tried out for the first time in this context &#8212; is really nice. We&#8217;ll definitely encourage folks to do this in the future.</p>
