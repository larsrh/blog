<blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.iaas.uni-stuttgart.de/institut/mitarbeiter/leymann/indexE.php">Frank Leymann</a> is a full professor at the University of Stuttgart and co-author of many Web Service specifications, including WSFL, WS-Addressing, WS-Metadata Exchange, WS-Business Agreement, and the WS-Resource Framework set of specifications. He was one of the driving forces behind BPEL4WS. Together with other researchers, he has published <a href="http://drops.dagstuhl.de/opus/volltexte/2006/524/pdf/05462.SWM.Paper.524.pdf">a paper proposing a research roadmap</a> for service-oriented computing. InfoQ&#8217;s Stefan Tilkov recently had the chance to talk to Frank about the roadmap, REST, WS-* standards, and SOA in general.

<p>I don&#8217;t have much experience in interviewing people, but this was definitely fun.</p>

<p>I liked the work he did on FlowMark (BM-Graphs) back to 94. Funnily BPEL is a little different syntax of that ;-)</p>
