<blockquote>
<p>RDF has after a decade seen limited deployment, developers and publishers peferring instead to incrementally patch syntax. Atom has XML extensions and rel attributes. HTML has RDFa and microformats. A few years ago RDF tended to be heavily criticised by syntax proponents. […] I hope a year or two out, people will be less dismissive and at least willing to learn from RDF as the nuisance factor of formats and media type limit increases.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Based on my extremely limited understanding of RDF, I tend to agree. I believe some good examples of the same (ideally RESTful) scenario built using a homegrown XML format vs. RDF could help tremendously. Any pointers?</p>
