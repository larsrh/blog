<p><a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/richardt/archive/2005/05/04/414833.aspx">Rich Turner</a> and <a href="http://radovanjanecek.net/blog/archives/000227.html">Radovan Janecek</a> going back and forth about the definition of SOA &#8230; very interesting. </p>

<p>While I&#8217;m not entirely sure that an SOA absolutely must include a registry as one of its component, I&#8217;m sure it doesn&#8217;t need an ESB &#8212; in fact I insist that the need for a central infrastructure component is exactly what we want to avoid with the whole SOA idea.</p>
