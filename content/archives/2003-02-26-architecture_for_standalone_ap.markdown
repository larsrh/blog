<p>I came across <a href="http://www.theserverside.com/discussion/thread.jsp?thread_id=18028" title="Java Email Librarian ZOE 0.4 Announced">this article at TSS about ZOE</a>, and also somehow found out about a tool called <a href="http://www.disobey.com/amphetadesk/" title="AmphetaDesk">AmphetaDesk</a>. Both offer functionality to aggregate news taken from RSS feeds; ZOE also provides for e-mail and other stuff. What's interesting is that both are desktop tools, but are implemented as small web servers that provide their UI to the browser.</p>
