<p>At <a href="http://www.sigs-datacom.de/sd/kongresse/oop_2007/index.php">OOP 2007</a>, <a href="/blog/pg/">Phillip</a> and I did our first public <a href="http://www.sigs-datacom.de/sd/kongresse/oop_2007/program.php?cat=session&amp;ID=148">Ruby on Rails tutorial</a> (the ones we did before were in-house). One day is very short for all of the framework, but I still like to believe we did a decent job (if you happen to have attended, and also read this, I&#8217;d appreciate a comment). </p>

<p>This marks <a href="/">innoQ</a>&#8217;s official entry into the Rails consulting business (in Germany, for the moment), which has three consequences:</p>

<ul>
<li>We&#8217;re actively looking for projects that are candidates for being built with Rails. This includes projects that require extremely short development time, projects where a company is looking to assess RoR&#8217;s enterprise readiness, and projects where there&#8217;s a non-technical customer who simply doesn&#8217;t care about technology. For particularly interesting projects, we&#8217;ll offer extremely competitive deals. <a href="mailto:info@innoq.com">Contact us</a> if you&#8217;re interested.</li>
<li>We&#8217;ll offer one-day and three-day tutorials, both publicly (in our offices in Ratingen and Darmstadt) and in-house. Again, <a href="http://mailto:info@innoq.com">drop us an email</a> to find out more.</li>
<li>This does not only mean that we&#8217;re going to actively hire Ruby and Rails developers, but also that we offer developers who have a different background, but are interested in RoR, a chance to actually work with it. (And yes, <a href="http://www.jroller.com/page/cpurdy?entry=how_to_get_a_macbook">you can get a Mac</a> at innoQ, too.)</li>
</ul>

<p>The main reason is that <em>Rails just rocks</em>.</p>
