<blockquote>
<p>Many people have tried to come up with a definitive list of lessons from the Web. In this article I present my own list, which is firmly slanted towards the role of the software architect in managing competing demands over a large architecture.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Here&#8217;s his list:</p>

<ul>
<li>You can&#8217;t upgrade the whole Web</li>
<li>Protocols must evolve</li>
<li>Protocols must be decoupled to evolve</li>
<li>Object identification must be free to evolve</li>
<li>New object interactions must be able to be added over time</li>
<li>Prefer low-semantic-precision document types over newly-invented document types</li>
<li>Ignore parts of content that are not understood</li>
<li>Be cautious about the use of namespaces in documents</li>
<li>New content types must be able to be added over time</li>
<li>Keep It Simple</li>
</ul>
