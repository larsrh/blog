<p>Naturally, electronic voting machines are evil; still, <a href="http://dilbertblog.typepad.com/the_dilbert_blog/2006/10/electronic_voti.html">Scott Adams&#8217;s line of reasoning</a> is compelling:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I think about the history of ATMs when I hear all the nervous Nellies wetting their pants over electronic voting machines. I believe those worries are totally misplaced. Now don&#8217;t get me wrong &#8211; there&#8217;s a 100% chance that the voting machines will get hacked and all future elections will be rigged.  But that doesn&#8217;t mean we&#8217;ll get a worse government. It probably means that the choice of the next American president will be taken out of the hands of deep-pocket, autofellating, corporate shitbags and put it into the hands of some teenager in Finland. How is that not an improvement?</p>
