<p>I finally decided to risk upgrading my <a href="http://www.movabletype.org/">MovableType</a> installation to <a href="http://www.movabletype.org/news/2004_07.shtml#001138">3.01D</a>. I had postponed this because I was convinced I would run into lots of compatibility problems, since I use a whole bunch of plug-ins. Fortunately, upgrading was trivial and it seems everything is running smoothly &#8230; I&#8217;m sure that something will show up later on, but for the moment, I continue to be a happy <a href="http://www.sixapart.com">SixApart</a> customer.</p>
