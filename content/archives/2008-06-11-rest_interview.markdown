<p>When I first <a href="/blog/st/2008/05/software_engineering_radio_int.html">linked</a> to <a href="http://se-radio.net/podcast/2008-05/episode-98-stefan-tilkov-rest">the podcast Markus Völter did with me a while back</a>, I hadn&#8217;t actually listened to it. Now I&#8217;ve done that (unsure what this says about my ego), I&#8217;ll note that Markus actually managed to extracted some answers I can&#8217;t remember having written down before.  So maybe it <em>is</em> worth listening to, after all (I have a hard time listening to my own voice, but that&#8217;s normal, I guess).</p>

<p>I actually listened to a few other of Software Engineering&#8217;s podcasts, too – there is some really great stuff, such as the one on <a href="http://www.se-radio.net/podcast/2008-01/episode-84-dick-gabriel-lisp">Lisp with Richard Gabriel</a>, as well as some really bad ones, like the one with <a href="http://www.se-radio.net/podcast/2008-02/episode-85-web-services-olaf-zimmermann">Olaf Zimmermann</a> :-) In any case, it shows that Markus knows his stuff, re-affirming my belief in the quality of unprofessional journalism.</p>

<p>Hi Stefan,
I have listened to the Olf Zimmermann podcast also. Can I ask what you did not like about it? I am writing a paper on the pro&#8217;s and con&#8217;s of WS-<em>, REST and POX.. Summary thus far:
WS-</em> advantages are : protocol transparency/independence; QoS (reliability, xactions,
security); mature tooling (rpc-style leads to quick learning curve).
WS-* disadvantages are - URL is of SOAP server => proxies and cache servers cant do their work; not consistent with Semantic Web; unique interface (WSDL) is not scalable; too many specs. can be confusing.
REST advantages are: simplicity; proxy/cache servers can do their job; consistent with Sem Web; uniform interface is scalable; disadvantages are: how does REST implement QoS?;
- is Bill de hOras HTTPLR RESTs answer to reliability?
- I think HTTPS is fine for security
- how does REST deal with transactions??
POX  : the only reason I have this in here is that a big bank here implemented SOA
without knowing of REST and they did not like SOAP - they just sent XML msgs
back and forth&#8230;</p>

<p>Have I missed anything?</p>

<p>Thanks,
Sean.</p>

<p>Hi Sean, maybe you want to check out: <a href="http://www.infoq.com/articles/tilkov-rest-doubts">http://www.infoq.com/articles/tilkov-rest-doubts</a></p>

<p>My main problem with Olaf&#8217;s statement was that &#8220;all of the REST principles are available in the WS-* core&#8221;, which is just plain bullshit.</p>

<p>Thanks Stefan. Can you explain in more detail what you meant in the interview by not using sessions. Could you give an example please. </p>

<p>Thanks,
Sean.</p>
