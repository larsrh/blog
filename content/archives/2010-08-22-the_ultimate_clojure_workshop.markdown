<p>It's no secret that I've become I big fan of <a href="http://clojure.org/">Clojure</a> in the last year or so. I've done three talks, collaborated on a series of print articles (<a href="http://www.sigs-datacom.de/fileadmin/user_upload/zeitschriften/js/2010/02/neppert_tilkov_JS_02_10.pdf">part 1</a>, <a href="http://www.sigs-datacom.de/fileadmin/user_upload/zeitschriften/js/2010/03/neppert_tilkov_JS_03_10.pdf">2</a> and <a href="http://www.sigs-datacom.de/fileadmin/user_upload/zeitschriften/js/2010/04/neppert_tilkov_JS_04_10.pdf">3</a>) and <a href="http://www.heise.de/developer/artikel/Clojure-Ein-pragmatisches-Lisp-fuer-die-JVM-1030144.html">an online article</a> to promote it as much as I can, and I think I made up with enthusiasm for my lack of practical experience. But I'm definitely not experienced enough with the language to do a multi-day workshop that would stand up to some tough questions. On the contrary, in fact I'd <em>love</em> to attend an advanced workshop done by some really smart folks who have more than introductory-level knowledge.</p>

<p>So I got in touch with two of the most respected Clojure folks in Europe, <a href="http://clj-me.cgrand.net/">Christophe Grand</a> and <a href="http://www.bestinclass.dk/blog.html">Lau B. Jensen</a>, and asked them whether they'd be interested in doing one of their conj-labs trainings in Germany. And they agreed in exchange for my promise to help them a little with regards to marketing it around here. Which I've gladly agreed to do :-)</p>

<p>So, mark the date: From 26 to 28 October, Frankfurt will be the place to learn about one of the coolest programming languages on the planet. What are you waiting for? <a href="http://www.conj-labs.eu/">Find out more</a>, <a href="http://www.conj-labs.eu/registration.html">register now</a>, and please help spread the word.</p>

<p>(Next up: A bunch of good reasons in German to use to help convincing your boss, if you happen to have one – stay tuned.)</p>
