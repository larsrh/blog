<p>Stefan, where is a review of the German cuisine? I think I recall a French quote for that: &#8220;Les Fran√ßais sont des gourmets, et les Allemands sont des gourmands&#8221;. Personally I think they are too chauvinist, and I prefer a Bratwurst over an Escargot or Foie Gras&#8230;</p>

<p>P.S. A delicious break with the usual SOA/XML/IT blogging habit ;-).</p>

<p>Right, the German cuisine is sadly missing. Not a great loss, though :-)</p>

<p>I freely admit to gourmand status, even when escargots are concerned! Although too much gourmet food makes me crave a fast food dinner once in a while.</p>

<p>I visited Iceland and couldn&#8217;t get the rotted shark past my nose &#8212; completely revolting. After that, the wind-dried cod tasted pretty good.</p>
