<p><a href="http://www.wordyard.com/">Scott Rosenberg</a> publishes a series of essays about influential computer science papers; all of them are very much worth reading. <a href="http://www.wordyard.com/2006/11/06/dijkstra-notes/">This time</a>, he takes a look at Dijkstra&#8217;s paper from 1970:</p>

<blockquote>
At the heart of &#8220;Notes on Structured Programming&#8221; lies Dijkstra&#8217;s advocacy of a particular approach to a program&#8217;s layered structure: &#8220;Each program layer is to be understood all by itself, under the assumption of a suitable machine to execute it, while the function of each layer is to simulate the machine that is assumed to be available on the level immediately above it.&#8221;

This &#8220;imaginary hardware&#8221; vision of abstraction may be foreign to the contemporary programming mindset; Dijkstra explains (in &#8220;What Led to &#8216;Notes&#8230;&#8217;&#8221;) that he&#8217;d come to this way of thinking from his experiences early in his career of writing software for hardware that was still being built and couldn&#8217;t yet run the programs. He worked that way so the code would be ready in time to ship with the new machines.
</blockquote>

<p>This reminds me of a Paul Graham essay &#8212; Dijkstra&#8217;s machine was hardware, <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/progbot.html">Graham&#8217;s is software</a> (and grows to meet the program&#8217;s needs).</p>
