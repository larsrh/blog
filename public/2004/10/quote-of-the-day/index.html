<p>I think I can safely say that none of the real problems I face have much to do with the fact that I need to do casts, or the fact that I can&#8217;t express something with less typing or whatever. In fact, none of the problems I face have much at all to do with the language I&#8217;m using. No, the problems I have now are the same problems I had 15 years ago. Reducing complexity, increasing robustness, enhancing expressiveness. Stuff like that. I suppose it&#8217;s possible I&#8217;m missing something, but I don&#8217;t see any language that helps me with those things at the fundamental level I&#8217;m looking for.</p>
