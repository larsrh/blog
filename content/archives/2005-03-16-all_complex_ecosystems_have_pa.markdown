<p><a href="http://craphound.com/complexecosystems.txt">Cory Doctorow on DRM</a> - smart, smart stuff:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Likewise, DRM has exacted a punishing toll wherever it has come
into play, costing us innovation, free speech, research and the
public&#8217;s rights in copyright. And likewise, DRM has not stopped
infringement: today, infringement is more widespread than ever.
All those costs borne by society in the name of protecting
artists and stopping infringement, and not a penny put into an
artist&#8217;s pocket, not a single DRM-restricted file that can&#8217;t be
downloaded for free and without encumbrance from a P2P network.</p>
