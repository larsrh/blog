<p><a href="http://www.davidchappell.com/blog/2007/06/rest-vs-ws-war-is-over-if-you-want-it.html">David Chappell</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>To anybody who&#8217;s paying attention and who&#8217;s not a hopeless partisan, the war between REST and WS-* is over. The war ended in a truce rather than crushing victory for one side&#8212;it&#8217;s Korea, not World War II. The now-obvious truth is that both technologies have value, and both will be used going forward.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I couldn&#8217;t disagree more &#8212; I&#8217;m seeing this particular reasoning more and more often in the last few months:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A RESTful approach is a natural for data-oriented applications that focus on create/read/update/delete scenarios. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>&#8230; with the implicit assumption that this restricts RESTful HTTP to an alternative applicable only for a subset of scenarios. To which I say: <em>Bullshit</em>.</p>

<p><em>Update:</em> <a href="http://pezra.barelyenough.org/blog/2007/07/rest-vs-ws-war/">Peter Williams</a> writes:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I expect that when all is said and done WS-* will still be around. But rather than as a vibrate technology platform, the way Mr Chappell seems to anticipate, I think it survive in a way far more like the way Cobol is still around today: as a zombie, unkillable and ready to eat the brain of anyone who wanders too close the legacy systems.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>Update 2:</em> <a href="http://cafe.elharo.com/xml/north-and-south/">Elliotte Rusty Harold</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>That&#8217;s a nice analogy. Take it one step further though. WS-* is North Korea and REST is South Korea. While REST will go on to become an economic powerhouse with steadily increasing standards of living for all its citizens, WS-* is doomed to sixty+ years of starvation, poverty, tyranny, and defections until it eventually collapses from its own fundamental inadequacies and is absorbed into the more sensible policies of its neighbor to the South.</p>

<p>I disagree with using data (CRUD) vs. business process as the decision axis. That is a meaningless way to draw fake distinctions.</p>

<p>In a recent post (see link comment link) I argue that:</p>

<p>1) Client/Server Request/Response systems should use REST.
2) P2P and asynchronous message passing systems should use SOA.</p>

<p>John, did you mean to write &#8220;message passing systems should use SOA&#8221;, or was that supposed to be &#8220;use SOAP&#8221;?</p>

<p>Stefan,</p>

<p>Thanks for your question. I plan on re-organizing my thoughts and publishing this idea again. More clearly this next time :)</p>
