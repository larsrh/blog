<p><a href="http://www.25hoursaday.com/weblog/2007/09/18/MessageQueuesDenormalizationAndScalability.aspx">Dare Obasanjo</a> believes my post on AMQP/XMPP is &#8220;rather dreadful&#8221;.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You&#8217;d have thought that the REST vs. SOAP debates would have put to rest the pointlessness that is dividing up protocols based on &#8220;enterprise&#8221; vs. &#8220;Web&#8221; or even worse binary vs. XML. I expect better from Stefan. :-)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Ouch, that hurt :-) I concede the &#8220;enterprise&#8221; vs. &#8220;Web&#8221; point, but I believe Dare will be among the first to agree XML is not appropriate for everything &#8212; so I don&#8217;t see why choosing a protocol based on this distinction should not be reasonable. I&#8217;ll prefer IP, TCP and UDP to the <a href="http://ftp.isi.edu/in-notes/rfc3252.txt">Binary Lexical Octet Ad-hoc Transport</a> any day.</p>

<p>But now, I&#8217;ll follow <a href="http://www.quoteworld.org/quotes/8321">Dare&#8217;s advice</a> and keep quiet on this topic until I have at least played with AMQP and XMPP for a few hours (not to be expected anytime soon).</p>

<p>Why keep quiet?  We can&#8217;t all play with everything.  Well, in fact, no one can play with everything.  I think it&#8217;s fair to question things you don&#8217;t have in-depth experience on, if you&#8217;re asking interesting questions.  You might be wrong.  And then you learned something.  And if you blog it, then so will we.</p>

<p>Thanks Patrick; I&#8217;m not known for having a problem to talk about stuff I&#8217;m only vaguely familiar with :-)</p>
