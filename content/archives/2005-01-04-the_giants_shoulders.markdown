<p>I&#8217;ve yet to come across another example of someone so eloquently missing the point as <a href="http://www.adambosworth.net/archives/000040.html">Adam Bosworth in this posting</a>.</p>

<p>reading Bosworth&#8217;s blog is such a waste of time.
BTW there is an interesting response to the posting you&#8217;re referring to at <a href="http://blog.kowalczyk.info/archives/2005/01/02/google-what-kind-of-a-giant-they-are/" rel="nofollow" /><a href="http://blog.kowalczyk.info/archives/2005/01/02/google-what-kind-of-a-giant-they-are/" rel="nofollow">http://blog.kowalczyk.info/archives/2005/01/02/google-what-kind-of-a-giant-they-are/</a></p>

<p>Yeah, you&#8217;re right. Missing the point. When Einstein said that (I think it was Einstein, right?) what other had done was available in form of scientific articles or books. All the theories, discoveries available so that he could advance&#8230;</p>
