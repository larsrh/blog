<p>At QCon London this year, I did <a href="http://www.infoq.com/interviews/robinson-webber-rest">an interview with Ian Robinson and Jim Webber</a>. It was pretty hard for me to not step out of the interviewer role as of course everything they said was just plain wrong! </p>

<p>Seriously though, I think this was very interesting, and I do in fact agree with almost everything. One thing I have a different opinion about is that I think the REST community should be grateful for the REST posse (or "REST djihadists", as I believe Jim likes to call them) â€“ IMO, they saved REST from suffering a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Betamax">Betamax</a> fate. </p>
