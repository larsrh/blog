<p>More food for thought from <a href="http://patricklogan.blogspot.com/2007/03/fit-wiki-rules-spaces.html">Patrick Logan</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I will repeat: in my experience, Jini and Javaspaces make Java applications as close to a concurrent, distributed, dynamic system experience as can be done. If you would like to use Erlang, but have to use Java, then try using Jini and Javaspaces.<br />We&#8217;re just getting started with this experiment, but everyone&#8217;s seeing the advantages over even the relatively flexible JMS products.</p>
