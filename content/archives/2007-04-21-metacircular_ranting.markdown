<p>By the end of writing <a href="http://metacircular.wordpress.com/2007/04/05/delusions-of-skill-and-of-grandeur/">this rant</a> about <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2007/04/04/trash-techcrunch-and-win-a-free-pass-to-the-web-20-expo/">TechChrunch&#8217;s Michael Arrington</a>, Warren Henning&#8217;s blood pressure was probably around 250 &#8230;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>He’s fooling himself into thinking he’s doing something important. He’s labelling and categorizing all these useless Web 2.0 startups that have no business model, speculating on their non-existent futures, commenting on and writing about the products others create. Arrington is a lawyer, not a coder. He doesn’t actually understand what a web application is the way someone whose automotive skills are limited to changing the oil doesn’t really understand how an internal combustion engine works.           </p>
