<p><a href="http://wanderingbarque.com/nonintersecting/2007/01/03/reinventing-the-ws-stack/">Yet another excellent post</a> by Pete Lacey. I&#8217;m in violent agreement and don&#8217;t have much to add; one thing I&#8217;ll note is that <a href="http://www.markbaker.ca/blog/">Mark</a> has convinced me long ago that protocol independence is a bug, not a feature. I assume this is a sentiment shared by many REST proponents &#8212; meaning they don&#8217;t tend to replace a MOM-based system by a RESTful solution if MOM semantics are what the situation calls for.</p>
