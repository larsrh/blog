<p>I&#8217;ve finally managed to arrive at <a href="http://europe.railsconf.org/">RailsConf Europe</a>; you can expect either light or Rails-related only blogging today and tomorrow :-)</p>

<p>For a change, it&#8217;s actually pretty neat to attend a conference without any speaking duties. I&#8217;m looking forward to <a href="http://www.loudthinking.com/">DHH</a>&#8217;s keynote (about to start in 15 minutes), and even more so for tomorrow&#8217;s presentation by <a href="http://whytheluckystiff.net/">_why</a>.</p>
