<p>It's amazing how much time one can spend with tuning CSS and MT templates - essentially with next to no measurable effect. I'm really in awe of people who are able to build things like <a href="http://www.csszengarden.com/?cssfile=/026/026.css&amp;page=0">this</a>, let alone <a href="http://www.csszengarden.com/?cssfile=001%2F001%2Ecss">this</a>. Maybe I should hire somebody to do this ... on the other hand, what would I then do with my evenings?</p>
