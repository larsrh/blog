<p>Via <a href="http://www.thearchitect.co.uk/weblog/archives/2004/02/000282.html">Jorgen Thelin</a> I came across <a href="http://ws.apache.org/ws-fx/index.html">WSFX</a>, an Apache project to create open source WS-* implementations. It seems to be in its infancy, but there are already subprojects for WS-ReliableMessaging (<a href="http://ws.apache.org/ws-fx/sandesha/index.htm">Sandesha</a>) and <a href="http://ws.apache.org/ws-fx/addressing">WS-Addressing</a>.
I strongly believe that support for asynchronous interactions is a critical factor to deliver on the Web service promise of <a href="http://www.manageability.org/blog/archive/20021122%23grand_unified_theory_of_loose/view">Loose Coupling</a>, and for wide-spread acceptance of any standard, having an open source implementation is great.</p>
