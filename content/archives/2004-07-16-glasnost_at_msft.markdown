<p>I&#8217;m not deep into .NET, but I find the fact that <a href="http://www.25hoursaday.com/weblog/CommentView.aspx?guid=e9e50539-501d-4f3a-9639-91ef4cff6354">Dare Obasanjo</a> openly asks for what XML features .NET users would like to see in Orcas/Longhorn (the version of Visual Studio after Whidbey), and <a href="http://www.gotdotnet.com/team/dbox/default.aspx?key=2004-07-11T06:37:50Z">Don Box&#8217;s response</a> , which seems to really be totally un-political, extremely impressive. At least some folks at Microsoft really seem to be taking this new openness thing seriously.</p>
