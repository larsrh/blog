	  <p>In what has become a tradition when I'm in the mood, these are my unedited notes from Werner Vogels's keynote talk "Web-scale Computing: Compete on Ideas, not Resources" at IIR's (German) Web 2.0/SOA/EAM conference in Wiesbaden.</p>

<ul>
<li>everybody in the audience except two guys are Amazon customers</li>
<li>when you put something in your shopping cart, you don't want to care about the technical details</li>
<li>now: put off your Amazon customer hat, think of Amazon as a technology provider</li>
<li>shows example - subscription model for toilet paper!</li>
<li>"buy box" (the blue area) shows the best product for the customer - even if it's not sold by Amazon.com</li>
<li>being a platform provider means you have to be absolutely neutral</li>
<li>many other examples of websites powered by Amazon.com</li>
<li>some statistical data - 80M customers, 1.3M active resellers ...</li>
<li>retail, ecommerce (associates), infrastructure ws, enterprise customers</li>
<li>shows Amazon.com from 1995 - key idea back then: do something on the Web that you couldn't do otherwise (have all of the world's book in stock)</li>
<li>history: app server/database (1995-2001) --> service orientation --> massively scalable services</li>
<li>for one year, Amazon ran a mainframe DB</li>
<li>in 2001, the Web servers hit a performance/scalability wall</li>
<li>2001-2004: services</li>
<li>now, everything is massive scale</li>
<li>the secret sauce of Amazon.com: not its recommendations, but its capability to do anything at scale</li>
<li>1st step: modularization - co-locate data and the logic depending on it, no direct DB access anymore</li>
<li>now: ~1000 different services</li>
<li>a page will hit 250-350 services - even single lines, such as "sales rank", call a service</li>
<li>large services at the bottom (customer, product, offer) serve as indices to additional services</li>
<li>each team has a small team associated with it, responsible for building and running it - no separate operations dept</li>
<li>no better motivation to fix a bug than your beeper going off at 4 in the morning</li>
<li>software as bits as opposed to software as a service</li>
<li>one bug/one fix approach </li>
<li>the whole saas thing is a big lie! there's a big elephant in the room nobody's talking about</li>
<li>reason: between test and operate, you need to handle all the non-functionals - load balancing, scaling, utilization, ... </li>
<li>vendors have no idea how to handle these things b/c traditionally, the customers did it</li>
<li>most of the engineers' time was spent configuring router, managing load balancers, spending 70% of their time on undifferentiated heavy lifting</li>
<li>example: picture of AT&amp;T data center built near a trailer park - which of course was destroyed by a tornado</li>
<li>365 Maine downtown SF run 8 generators in their data center - three months ago 6 of 8 generators failed despite being tested --> most of Web 2.0 offline</li>
<li>Google study: 10% of disks will fail per year - w/ 80000 disks in a typical data center means 8000 disks fail per year -> you'll have people employed who <em>only</em> change disks</li>
<li>graph of target.com and walmart.com -> holiday peaks 2-3 times the rest of the year's average</li>
<li>lessons learned - offer 1000 wiis, 100000 people will show up</li>
<li>pitch for 37signals' "Getting Real"</li>
<li>Amazon.com web services: s3, sqs, ec2, simpledb, fps</li>
<li>was used internally for 2 years before it was offered externally</li>
</ul>

<p><em>Scalability</em></p>

<ul>
<li>growth by good customer experience -> traffic -> sellers -> selection -> lower prices -> customer experience</li>
<li>incremental scalability is key</li>
<li>being able to grow systems one step at a time</li>
<li>infrastructure needs to move from capital investment to variable cost</li>
<li>elastic: capable of growing <em>and shrinking</em> on demand</li>
<li>minimal disruption to customer performance</li>
<li>addresses: different growth paths, fault-tolerance, heterogeneity, operational efficiency</li>
<li>you can't assume your infrastructure is homegeneous</li>
</ul>

<p><em>Availability</em></p>

<ul>
<li>everything fails, all the time</li>
<li>somebody cuts a cable in the Suez canal - the rest of the world thinks India is gone</li>
<li>failures are highly correlated</li>
<li>things fail in groups</li>
<li>things don't fail by stopping - instead, systems fail by sending out large amounts of garbage</li>
<li>a load balancer sending to a machine returning very fast responses -- all 500s</li>
<li>let go of control - take a probabilistic approach: determinism doesn't exist in real life</li>
</ul>

<p><em>Performance</em></p>

<ul>
<li>engineering for performance for 99.9% </li>
<li>averages are irrelevant</li>
</ul>

<p><em>Cost effectiveness</em></p>

<ul>
<li>uncertainty</li>
<li>acquire resources on demand - you can't predict anything</li>
<li>release resources when no longer needed</li>
<li>the new economy is all about much intensified competition</li>
<li>don't rely on resources</li>
<li><p>the power of your success is now no longer in your hand</p></li>
<li><p>these four non-functional properties of large systems are dominated by state management</p></li>
<li><p>categorization of data access patterns</p>

<ul>
<li>primary key access (high read volume, always writable)</li>
<li>query-based access (relationless + relational)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>two large services: S3 and SimpleDB</li>
<li>EC2 with persistent storage for dedicated purposes</li>
<li>billions of objects in Amazon S3</li>
<li>the traffic out of Amazon's web services is larger than the traffic of all retail properties combined</li>
<li>availability zones</li>
<li>explanation of persistent storage for EC2</li>
<li>the big deal is: any type of legacy system can be run within the cloud</li>
<li>the only thing needed to get started: a credit card and http://aws.amazon.com (no contract, negotiations, ...)</li>
<li>(Question by yours truly: does AMazon.com use the services internally?)</li>
<li>Yes, extensively, given it's . If S3 ever failed, you'd notice it in Amazon.com
(Question: is Amazon impacted by the peak loads it has to handle?)</li>
<li>Amazon.com scale is basically dwarfed by the platform it offers for others, it profits just as much.</li>
</ul>

<p><em>Great</em> talk, too bad it was this short.</p>

<p>Thanks for the writeup &#8212; looks like they&#8217;re doing even cooler stuff than their products imply!</p>

<p>Stefan, great summary. Are slides of his talk available somewhere?</p>
