	  <p>Meta-blogging has got to be one the most annoying things people who write blogs do from time to time, and if you get as annoyed by it as I do, you&#8217;d better skip to your newsreader&#8217;s next entry right now :-)</p>

<p>I just wanted to get through a quick update: No, I have not stopped maintaining this weblog, it&#8217;s just that at the moment I somehow don&#8217;t seem to find many interesting things to write about, or even link to &#8212; not as if they aren&#8217;t out there somewhere, it&#8217;s just that I don&#8217;t get excited enough to actually spend time writing about them. Many of the things I&#8217;m currently working on will definitely merit some original writing, though, and I promise to actually start doing it Real Soon Now.</p>

<p>Stefan, I think metablogging is natural, look at how many books have been written about writing books, and nobody seems to complain. 8-)</p>

<p>On the other hand, promises of interesting new blog entries Real Soon Now must be one of the most annoying things people put in the blogs. 8-)</p>
