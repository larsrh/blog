<p><a href="http://bitworking.org/news/425/atompub-is-a-failure">Joe Gregorio</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>All of the advances in browsers and connectivity have conspired to keep AtomPub from reaching the widespread adoption that I had envisioned when work started on the protocol, but that doesn&#8217;t mean it&#8217;s a failure. There is still plenty of uses for AtomPub and it has quietly appeared in many places. Other use cases are still holding up over time, such as migrating data from one platform to another. Probably the biggest supplier of AtomPub based services is Google with the Google Data APIs, but it also has support from other services; just recently I noticed that flickr offers AtomPub as a method to post images to your blog. So it&#8217;s not a failure, but certainly the advancing browser platform has obviated many of the motivations behind its creation.</p>
