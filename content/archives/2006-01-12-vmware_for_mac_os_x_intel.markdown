<p>Sadly, I haven&#8217;t seen any plans from VMware regarding OS X/Intel support yet &#8230; so now&#8217;s a good time to try out this online petition thing: </p>

<p>Consider signing the <a href="http://www.petitiononline.com/vmwarosx/petition.html">VMware Mac OS X Petition</a> &#8212; who knows, maybe a few hundred supporters raised this way might convince some product manager &#8230;</p>
