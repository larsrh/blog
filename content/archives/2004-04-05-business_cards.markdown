<p>Sam Ruby explains <a href="http://www.intertwingly.net/blog/1753.html">why has made a point of not carrying business cards</a>:</p>

<blockquote>Prior to the second such meeting (different customer), I inquired as to how I could acquire business cards of my own. My manager at the time checked into it and told me that the expense was denied.</blockquote>

<p>There is only one possible answer: Any company where employees need to &#8220;rank&#8221; to get business cards is not worth working for. Period.</p>
