<p><a href="http://www.slate.com/id/2133551/?nav=navoa">How an obscure British skit has become Germany&#8217;s most popular New Year&#8217;s tradition.</a>. Like any good German, I have watched this religiously every New Year&#8217;s Eve, at least in the last 25 years.</p>

<p>I&#8217;d heard about this skit 25 or so years ago when a drunk German friend decided to reenact the whole sketch in the local pub. Given the sketch is completely unknown in England. After failing to raise a single smile poor old Horst was left as puzzled as his audience - &#8220;but, but it&#8217;s a British sketch, it&#8217;s famous&#8221;! Now, at last, I can see what the fuss was about ;-)</p>
