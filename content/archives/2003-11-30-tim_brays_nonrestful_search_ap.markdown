<p>Tim Bray continues his <a href="http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2003/11/16/SearchAPIs">On Search</a> series, and describes a hypothetical, Web-based interface.</p>

<p>If you take a look at the XML fragments, it seems to me that this is pure Web-based, but clearly not <a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~fielding/pubs/dissertation/top.htm">REST</a>-based. I wonder whether that is intentional?</p>
