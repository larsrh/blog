<p>In <a href="http://www.randomhacks.net/articles/2005/12/03/why-ruby-is-an-acceptable-lisp">Why Ruby is an acceptable LISP</a>, Eric Kidd makes a good argument for Lisp geeks to consider Ruby.</p>

<p>I spent quite a bit of time recently with both Ruby (and Ruby on Rails) &#8212; and without a doubt, I consider it to be the most productive programming language (and web framework, respectively) that&#8217;s currently available. As usual, this might change once I&#8217;ve done a larger project with it &#8212; you just have to find out the hard way where exactly the tools suck (and all of them do, just to a varying degree). I used to hope for a good Lisp or Scheme+JVM combination, but I suppose Ruby will do just fine.</p>
