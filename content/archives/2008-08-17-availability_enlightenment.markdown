<blockquote>
<p>Approaching the room at a hurried pace was a young engineer. Stress was clear upon his face. He was obviously in need of guidance, help with some crisis. As he approached the desk, the older engineer turned and met him with a calm steady stare. Our young engineer quickly introduces himself, "Hello, my name is Bill, they say you are the fellow". The older man nods, and offers Bill a seat with a motion of his hand and offers, "You can call me TF for short." And our story begins.</p>
