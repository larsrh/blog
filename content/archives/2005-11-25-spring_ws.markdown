<p><a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0112098/2005/11/23.html#a542">James Strachan</a> points to <a href="http://blog.springframework.com/arjen/index.php/archives/2005/11/22/spring-web-services-object-xml-mapping/">Spring WS</a>, another effort to create an open source Web services framework. To quote him:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Worse it doesn&#8217;t seem to play nice with any other SOAP stack and completely ignores JSR 181 and JAX-WS which are where its at these days for SOAP stacks.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Needless to say, I couldn&#8217;t disagree more &#8212; I consider JAX-WS to be an abomination. In fact, I think that Spring WS&#8217;s design goals, as outlined in <a href="http://www.springframework.org/node/186">this presentation</a>, are very much in line with Alpine&#8217;s goals (as outlined in the original <a href="http://www.hpl.hp.com/techreports/2005/HPL-2005-83.pdf">paper by Steve and Ed</a> and <a href="/blog/st/2005/05/25/alpine_design_goals.html">paraphrased by yours truly here</a>).</p>

<p>I&#8217;m also pretty convinced that the NIH principle is a non-issue in open source software.</p>
