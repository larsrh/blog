<blockquote>
<p>We launched <a href="http://kenai.com/">Project Kenai</a> very quietly last Friday. It’s a developer hub with SCM and issue tracking and forums and all the other stuff you’d expect. We built it because we needed it, but it’s open for use by the world for free. For a newborn infant, it looks pretty good. [... ] There are lots of interesting things about Kenai; among other things, it’s a Rails app.</p>
