<p>Then, on Friday, I stumbled over something that looks promising: <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/devlabs/dd795202.aspx">Axum</a>.<br />And the more I read about it and the more I play around (it is really just playing, trying to grok, to understand, to learn) the more I <em>think</em> this <em>could</em> be the future of parallel programming and processing.</p>
