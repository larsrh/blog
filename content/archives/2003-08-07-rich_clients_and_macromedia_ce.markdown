<p><a href="http://www.adambosworth.net">Adam Bosworth</a> <a href="http://www.adambosworth.net/archives/000004.html" title="Adam Bosworth's Weblog: Detour"> elaborates</a> on the Rich Client concept, and points to a <a href="http://www.macromedia.com/software/central/whitepaper/central_wp.pdf">Macromedia whitepaper</a> about their new product, Macromedia Central.<br />
The concept - as far as I gather from a brief look at the paper - makes a lot of sense. With all of the UI frameworks available for different programming languages, I have not yet seen something that in my view deserves to be called an application framework. Central seems to be just that - providing not only visual functionality, but also a pre-defined model for communications, local storage, a sort of desktop metaphor, etc. The central question (or Central question? bua hua hua) seems to be whether this idea, although excellent in principle, will gain traction while tied to a proprietary, non-standardized environment. <br />
For buildling rich clients, I concede that <a href="http://www.w3.org/MarkUp/Forms/">XForms</a>, while interesting and intended to be a standard, don't play in the same league. <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/projects/xul/">XUL</a> seems not to be taken seriously enough. Some time ago, there was a <a href="http://www.jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=143">JSR</a> that addressed something along these lines, but it was rejected - if I remember correctly, it was withdrawn by its author. <br />
Perhaps the time for adressing this again has come.</p>
