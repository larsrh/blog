<blockquote>
<p>Turns out JRuby had no problems managing 8GB of memory and 6 million plus objects being passed around over DRb. Having the JVM do memory management for your Ruby objects isn’t that bad. I didn’t have to care about it anymore and not caring about the JVM is lighyears ahead of caring about MRI memory management. Yes, there is real value to using the JVM.</p>
