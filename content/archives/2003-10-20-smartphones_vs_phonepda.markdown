<p><a href="http://www2.schmidetzki.net/WebGatePublisher/schmidetzki/html/default/webb-5shmbh.de.0" title="Schmidetzki.Net">Wolfgang</a> shares his experience with his P800 smartphone. I have to agree &mdash; I used to own a Nokia 9110i, then a 9210i (also known as the "Nokia Communicator"), and recently bought a T-Mobile MDA. Basically, all of these solutions suck. Then again, I may not be the best reference, since I have never been an avid Palm or iPaq user. To me, it now seems to make the most sense to have a decent, not-too-fancy phone and do the rest on the notebook computer that I carry around all of the time, anyway.</p>
