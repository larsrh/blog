<p>Dare Obsanjo shares some <a href="http://www.25hoursaday.com/weblog/PermaLink.aspx?guid=7434dcc2-22ae-426f-ae5c-37c2fc6ec87b">thoughts on WinFS</a>:</p>

<blockquote>The main reasons applications don&#8217;t talk to each other isn&#8217;t a lack of technology [&#8230;]  but for various social and business reasons. </blockquote>

<p>He continues to point out that the main benefit in WinFS is, in his opinion, not the much-hyped enhanced search facilities, but the fact that applications that use WinFS to store their data would be interoperable.</p>
