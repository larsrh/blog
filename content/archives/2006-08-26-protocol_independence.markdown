<p>Nick Gall asks &#8220;<a href="http://ironick.typepad.com/ironick/2006/08/what_were_we_th.html">What were we thinking?</a>&#8221;  with regards to SOAP/WSDL and protocol independence. I tend to agree, but <a href="http://www.25hoursaday.com/weblog/PermaLink.aspx?guid=d727f91c-56a3-40d6-9c45-25a2c5b6ec2d">Dare Obasanjo&#8217;s arguments</a> should not be ignored. Maybe I would feel similar if I had some Indigo/WCF experience, of if there were a similar Java toolkit.</p>
