<p>I have to whole-heartedly agree with <a href="http://schneider.blogspot.com/archives/2004_06_13_schneider_archive.html#108746746780394289">Jeff Schneider</a>: While SOA and Web services and REST are all exciting, they don&#8217;t exist on their own. My personal interest is to find ways to combine MDA (whether UML-based or not) and SOA (whether REST-based or not) &#8212; leading to a metadata-driven, efficient process for designing, creating and managing services as IT assets.</p>
