<p>I was looking for a way to ease our company-internal collaboration, and decided to give the Wiki concept a try again. We did this a couple of years ago, using a slightly modified version of Ward Cunningham&#8217;s original Wiki code. Then we introduced Lotus Domino, and our Wiki died.</p>

<p>While I like Notes/Domino a lot, its support for building a web of crosslinked documents is very limited. One of its major strengths, though, is replication &mdash; a feature that is critical to us, since many of us spend a lot of their time traveling, and being able to create a document that gets replicated later is a very cool thing. So I search around for offline-capable Wiki implementations. <a href="http://www.pycs.net/users/0000177/categories/blogtools/2003/10/10.html">Ed Taekema</a> was looking for something similar<a href="http://www.docuverse.com/blog/donpark/EntryViewPage.aspx?guid=838">, Don Park has written about Distributed Wikis</a>, and  <a href="http://www.codeconsult.ch/bertrand/archives/000134.html">Bertrand Delacr&#233;taz</a> suggests using a Wiki with CVS backend and synchronize this way. </p>

<p>I finally decided to try out a project called <a href="http://www.openntf.org/Projects/pmt.nsf/HomeLookup/44331B739D4A622988256D55004BDD23?OpenDocument">BeeWiki</a> which is hosted on <a href="http://www.openntf.org">OpenNTF</a>.  This is a pretty straight-forward Wiki clone, but it uses Domino as its backend. With this solution, it&#8217;s possible to use a Web browser <em>or</em> the Notes client to work with the Wiki contents.</p>

<p>Installation was dead simple, and this looks very promising. Chances are we&#8217;ll discover something that will prevent us from sticking with it (a strong tendency here), but we&#8217;ll definitely give it a try &#8230;</p>
