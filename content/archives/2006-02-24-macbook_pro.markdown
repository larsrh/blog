<p><a href="/blog/st/2006/02/19/february.html">The new machine</a> has arrived &#8212; one day late, but just in time for the weekend.</p>

<p>First impressions:</p>

<ul>
<li>the screen is great; the additional pixels (extended width) is very usable</li>
<li>the keyboard feels different &#8212; I don&#8217;t know whether this is because it&#8217;s new and the one in my PowerBook was so worn out already, or whether there is any difference</li>
<li>the ability to transfer your home directory during installation makes the setup of a new machine extraordinarily easy. In fact, I booted the new machine up, and left it unattended (OK, almost &#8212; I checked every 5 minutes how far along it was) while it transfered 40 gig of data. Now I&#8217;m typing this entry on it &#8212; the only thing that has taken time is re-installing applications. I could have done this via the transfer mode, too, but I decided to take the opportunity to check for the latest versions, looking for universal binaries.</li>
<li>I can notice no difference at all in performance of PowerPC apps &#8212; e.g. NetNewsWire, OmniWeb, ecto run without any noticeable reduction in performance. In other words: Rosetta, the on-demand PowerPC-to-Intel translator, <em>rocks</em>. I&#8217;ll check out Microsoft Office next.</li>
<li>Safari seems super-fast, as well as the html rendering of Mail.app.</li>
<li>Seeing <a href="http://www.ragingmenace.com/software/menumeters/index.html#download">MenuMeters</a>  display the CPU usage percentage of two cores is just totally cool :-)</li>
</ul>

<p><strike>Next up: Installing Eclipse (3.2M5 is supposed to be a universal binary).</strike></p>

<p>Update: Eclipse feels about 10 times faster!</p>
