<p>You never know: maybe one of my (German) readers is looking for a challenging Java-related (permanent) job in Stuttgart, where one of our customers has failed to find someone appropriate until now. If you want to help build up a team that creates a company-wide SOA, using Java, Spring, Web services, open source tools, and integrates the whole thing with an SAP ERP installation, <a href="mailto:stefan.tilkov@innoq.com">drop me an email</a>.</p>
