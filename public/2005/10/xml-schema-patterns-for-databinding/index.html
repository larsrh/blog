	  <blockquote>
<p>The mission of this <a href="http://www.w3.org/2005/10/ws-databinding-charter.html">Working Group</a> is to define a set of XML Schema patterns that will be efficiently implementable by the broad community who use XML databindings. Patterns which may prove useful to model include abstractions of structures common across a wide variety of programming environments, such as hash tables, vectors, and collections. There are several ways of representing such abstracted data structures and Web Services toolkits are currently using ad hoc technologies to infer the most suitable language mapping when processing XML Schemas. Agreeing on a set of XML Schema patterns for which databinding optimizations can be made will facilitate the ability of Web services and other toolkits to expose a more comprehensible data model to the developer.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="http://blog.whatfettle.com/">Paul Downey</a> chairs the WG. I&#8217;m not a fan of XML data binding at all, but at least some of the most common problems seem to be addressed by this effort.</p>
