<p><a href="http://www.markbaker.ca/blog/2006/10/25/links-for-2006-10-25/">Mark Baker</a> links to <a href="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-tag/2006Oct/0061.html">the start of the discussion thread</a> about WS-Transfer in the Web architecture mailing list. I don&#8217;t see any way W3C could accept this submission, even if it were changed significantly; this is definitely going to be interesting.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s already been accepted as a submission!  The question is, what comes next?  I suspect the TAG might have been taken it up now because, behind the scenes, somebody&#8217;s trying to get a WG chartered.</p>

<p>Ah, I did not intend that to sound that way. I meant whether they accept the submission not in the process sense, but rather in the sense of it becoming an official W3C recommendation. I mean - even WS-Polling is a submission, isn&#8217;t it? ;-)</p>

<p>Ah, gotcha.</p>

<p>And thanks for reminding about WS-Polling, just when I&#8217;d managed to wipe the memory of its existence from my head - bastard! 8-)</p>
