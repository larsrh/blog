<p>A tiny detail in <a href="http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2004/06/02/AtomMeetingReport#p-28">Tim Bray&#8217;s report from the Atom community meeting</a> caught my eye:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Looking around the table, I see 11 Macintoshes and 3 other computers</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This leads to an observation that I believe isn&#8217;t clear enough to a lot of people: The Mac as a platform matters a lot, because even if its market share is negligible from a percentage point of view, it&#8217;s actually pretty significant among certain people. Thus, even if there may be no justification (judging potential license revenue) to develop something like, say, Weblogic for Mac OS X, it&#8217;s clearly a good idea to do so simply because it makes sure a lot of people will be able to play with it or do some research. </p>

<p>Luckily, OS X&#8217;s excellent Java support makes this pretty easy, at least for Java apps, unless you end up doing something as stupid as packaging your all-Java app in an installer that&#8217;s only executable on Windows.</p>
