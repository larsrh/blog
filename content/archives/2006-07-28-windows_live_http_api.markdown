<p><a href="http://www.microsoft-watch.com/article2/0,2180,1940334,00.asp">Microsoft&#8217;s Brian Arbogast</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Microsoft is still thinking through the business models and licensing models that will be permitted in the Windows Live world, Arbogast said. But the company has decided that a few key principles will prevail.<br />Users must be in control of their own data at all times, Arbogast said. Windows Live services should be designed to support any platform, browser, language or device, and Windows Live services should make use of <strong>simple, standards-adherent HTTP-based application programming interfaces</strong>, he added.</p>
