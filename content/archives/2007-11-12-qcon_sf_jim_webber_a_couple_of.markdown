<p>Jim Webber was way too fast, and way too funny, for me to take any notes &#8212; still, just to ensure I&#8217;ve treated all of &#8220;my&#8221; speakers equally, here&#8217;s a quick summary: Jim split his time equally between </p>

<ol>
<li>ensuring we&#8217;ll have to add a &#8220;parental guidance required&#8221; warning to his video once it&#8217;s online on <a href="http://www.infoq.com">InfoQ</a>,</li>
<li>insulting WSDL 1.1 (and WSDL 2.0) as well as its creator <a href="http://sanjiva.weerawarana.org/">Sanjiva Weerawarana</a> who was sitting in the row just behind me</li>
<li>creating fits of laughter, esp. for <a href="http://steve.vinoski.net/blog/">Steve Vinoski</a> (who was sitting next to me)</li>
<li>presenting some really great technical content.</li>
</ol>

<p>Initially, Jim talked about his view that MEST-style Web services are actually very useful, and that it&#8217;s the RPC concepts induced by WSDL that turn Web services into a mess. Then he spent some time assaulting both URL-RPC-style and POX-style HTTP misuses, although he found something positive in both &#8212; specifically, the fact that they&#8217;re dead simple to use. After a brief overview of the REST style, he showed an example of the use of hypermedia to drive the application&#8217;s state. </p>

<p>This was easily the most entertaining talk of the track, and I think it was a great way to conclude the day.</p>
