<blockquote>
<p>Today starts a new chapter of my life. After a year of hard work my team and I are coming out of stealth mode and launching a new company: Good Data Corporation.<br /><br />We&#8217;ve built a complete, on-demand business intelligence platform combining analytics, reporting, data warehousing and data integration. Our primary focus is collaborative analytics. We believe that sharing and teamwork will allow our users to move past isolated reports and arrive at the true meaning of &#8220;business intelligence.&#8221;<br /><br />How is it different? It&#8217;s fast, it&#8217;s flexible, and it&#8217;s on-demand. We&#8217;ve packed a sophisticated bundle into a simple package. By focusing on the right features, we&#8217;ve eliminated feature bloat. And it&#8217;s secure, too.</p>

<p>I have good reason to be sure that this is going to be a big disruption in the BI market.</p>
