<p>Taking a look at <a href="http://betathoughts.blogspot.com/2006/11/axis2-this-aint-rest.html">this example</a> of Axis2&#8217;s so-called REST support makes me wonder whether it could be any worse &#8212; it&#8217;s like someone set out to break as many REST rules as possible :-) Never mind <a href="/blog/st/2006/03/31/soapox.html">the conceptual problems</a> &#8230;</p>
